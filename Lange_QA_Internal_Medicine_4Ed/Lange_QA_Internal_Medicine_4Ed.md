1. (D) Wenckebach, or type I second-degree AV block, is characterized on ECG by progressive lengthening of the PR interval until there is a nonconducted P wave. The magnitude of PR lengthening declines with each beat, so the RR intervals characteristically shorten prior to the dropped beat. It is almost always caused by abnormal conduction across the AV node, and the QRS complex is usually of normal duration. (Fuster, p. 901)
2. (D) The ventricular inhibited (VVI) pacemaker functions when the heart rate falls below a preset interval. If a QRS is detected, the pacemaker is inhibited. If a QRS is not sensed, the pacing stimulus is not inhibited and the ventricle is stimulated. (Fuster, p. 909)
3. (D) Sinus tachycardia is the most common ECG finding in pulmonary embolism. The specific ECG signs of pulmonary embolism such as the S1, Q3, T3 are rarely seen except in cases of massive pulmonary embolism. In submassive pulmonary emboli, the ECG may show nonspecific ST changes and sinus tachycardia.

On occasion, pulmonary embolism can precipitate atrial flutter or fibrillation. One of the most useful roles of the ECG is to rule out MI when a massive embolism is present. (Fuster, pp. 1596-1597)
4. (C) Aortic stenosis is most likely to be associated with angina pectoris, syncope, and exertional dyspnea. Exertional syncope is caused by either systemic vasodilation in the presence of fixed or inadequate cardiac output, an arrhythmia, or both. Syncope at rest is most frequently
a result of a transient ventricular tachyarrhythmia. (Fuster, pp. 1645-1647)
5. (C) Common findings in infective endocarditis include petechiae, Roth's spots, Osler's nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages, stroke, and infarction of viscera, or extremities.

Many of the complications are thought to be embolic but may include vasculitis. Autopsy studies reveal that many systemic emboli go unrecognized. Brain, lung, coronary arteries, spleen, extremities, gut, and eyes are common locations for emboli. (Fuster, pp. 2010-2011)
6. (B) The slow channel for calcium assumes considerable importance in the region of the sinus node and AV node. For verapamil, this results in both antiarrhythmic and negative inotropic effects. Different classes of calcium channel blockers have differential effects on these slow channels, explaining the different clinical properties of the various calcium channel blocking drugs. (Fuster, pp. 950)
7. (D) Pericarditis secondary to transmural infarction is very common and most cases appear within 4 days. The most common manifestation of pericarditis is a friction rub along the left sternal border. It is evanescent, lasting only a few days. The pain is usually perceived by the patient to be different than that of the infarct. It is worsened by inspiration, swallowing, coughing, or lying down. It frequently is associated with a low-grade fever. (Fuster, p. 1980, 1995-1996)
8. (A) Positively inotropic is the best description of the effect of calcium ions on the myocardium.Calcium plays a role in excitationcontraction coupling, and in possible drug effects and heart failure. (Fuster, p. 129)
9. (C) In the past, there was concern that rigorous drug treatment would harm the fetus.

Studies now show benefit in controlling pressure with drugs, but ACE inhibitors are contraindicated because they might cause renal abnormalities in the fetus. Women who develop hypertension during pregnancy have a higher risk of developing hypertension in later life. (Fuster, p. 2217)
10. (E) There is a possible indication (but not an obligation) to insert a temporary pacemaker if a new LBBB occurs. If LBBB and a Mobitz type II AV block occur, there is general agreement on the usefulness of pacing. Temporary pacemaker is not required for first-degree block.

For second-degree block of the Wenckebach type (usually with an inferior infarction), pacing is only required if symptoms of bradycardia and hypotension cannot be controlled medically. The necessity for temporary pacing during an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) does not necessarily indicate that permanent pacing will be required. (Fuster, pp. 1323-1324)
11. (D) Pulmonary hypertension is associated with an increased intensity of the second heart sound, which coincides with the end of the T wave on ECG. It is the pulmonic component of the second heart sound that is increased. Pulmonary stenosis can cause dyspnea on exertion but auscultation will reveal a systolic murmur and decreased second heart sound (pulmonic component).

As well, there may be prominent $a$ waves in the jugular venous pulse, a right ventricular heave, an ejection click, and a right ventricular fourth heart sound. When signs and symptoms are apparent, the pulmonary hypertension is usually moderate to severe. (Fuster, pp. 1586-1587)
12. (D) The patient most likely has PSVT, since the tachycardia terminates after carotid sinus massage (CSM). CSM increases vagal tone
(parasympathetic) which decreases AV nodal conduction and terminates AV node re-entry arrhythmias. Sinus tachycardia differs from PSVT tachycardia in that it does not start or stop abruptly. In PSVT, the QRS is usually narrow without clearly discernible P waves. A wide QRS in PSVT can result from a preexisting bundle branch block, or a functional bundle branch block secondary to the tachycardia. This can make the distinction from a ventricular arrhythmia quite difficult. (Fuster, pp. 845-847)
13. (D) In the absence of critical CAD, angina pectoris occurs most frequently with aortic stenosis. AMI is usually due to associated atherosclerotic coronary occlusion. (Fuster, p. 1645)
14. (B) In aortic stenosis, the first sound is usually normal; the second sound is characteristically diminished because of the increased ventricular pressure and the stenotic valve is less mobile. There can be a single S2 either because A2 and P2 are superimposed or A2 is absent or very soft. Severe aortic stenosis may be accompanied by paradoxical splitting of S2. (Fuster, p. 1646)
15. (B) AV dissociation is the independent beating of atria and ventricles and is recognized on the ECG by fixed PP and RR intervals but variable PR intervals.

AV block is one cause of AV dissociation. (Fuster, pp. 904-905)
16. (E) Nitroglycerine is usually used in the setting of severe pulmonary congestion with adequate blood pressure. With significant hypotension, inotropic agents are generally administered prior to nitroglycerine. (Fuster, pp. 1316-1317)
17. (A) A ventricular septal defect is considered a relatively high-risk lesion for infective endocarditis.

Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, and pure mitral stenosis are considered an intermediate risk. Atrial septal defects of the secundum type are considered low risk. (Fuster, p. 2003)18. (A) The myxoma is a solitary globular or polypoid tumor varying in size from that of a cherry to a peach. About $75 \%$ are found in the left atrium, and most of the remainder in the right atrium. The clinical presentation is with one or more of the classical triad of constitution symptoms (fatigue, fever, anemia), embolic events, or obstruction of the valve orifice. (Fuster, pp. 2081-2082)
19. (A) Diltiazem and verapamil may be of help in both acute paroxysms of atrial flutter and chronic management. The other choices have no effect on the AV node to slow down flutter, and atropine accelerates AV conduction. At times, catheter ablation of the flutter pathway is required in chronic atrial flutter. Surgical ablation is reserved for cases where other surgical interventions are required. (Fuster, p. 844)
20. (C) Exercise electrocardiography represents an increasingly popular noninvasive method for early detection of latent ischemic heart disease. As with other diagnostic tests, the exercise ECG is of most clinical value when the pretest probability of disease is moderate (i.e., $30-70 \%$ ). In men over 40 and women over 50 who plan to start vigorous exercise, use of exercise ECG is possibly, but not definitely, supported by the evidence (class IIb). (Fuster, pp. 477-478)
21. (D) Contrast media used in cardiac catheterization may result in renal impairment. The group at highest risk includes diabetics with renal disease and those with preexisting renal failure. Good hydration is essential. Other manifestations of contrast media include nausea and vomiting (common), and anaphylactoid reactions characterized by low-grade fever, hives, itching, angioedema, bronchospasm, and even shock. Side effects are reduced with the use of new low osmolality contrast media. (Fuster, p. 489)
22. (E) Pericarditis in clinical practice is commonly idiopathic and frequently assumed to be of possible viral origin. Coxsackieviruses are a common cause, but herpesviruses are not. Although TB, rheumatic fever, and MI can
cause pericarditis, they are unlikely in this case. (Fuster, p. 1979)
23. (C) Left-heart catheterization is a more accurate measurement, but involves a slightly increased risk. End-expiratory PA diastolic pressure is very close ( $2-4 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) to wedge pressure as well. A discordance between wedge pressure and PA diastolic pressure suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension. (Fuster, p. 512)
24. (C) Aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring prompt attention. Other cardiac and pulmonary causes of chest pain can be quickly ruled out with ECG and CXR. CT scan of the chest is sensitive ( $93-100 \%$ ) in ruling out dissection. Transesophageal echocardiography is equally as sensitive but not a transthoracic echo. (Fuster, pp. 2312-2313)
25. (A) This is characteristic of an atrial septal defect. Pulmonary blood flow is greater because of increased blood flow from the right atrium, which receives blood from the vena cava and left atrium. (Fuster, pp. 1797-1798)
26. (B) Angina or infarction in young patients should prompt the physician to consider congenital coronary artery anomaly or congenital coronary artery aneurysm. Acquired coronary artery aneurysm can be caused by atherosclerosis, trauma, angioplasty, atherectomy, vasculitis, mycotic emboli, Kawasaki syndrome, or arterial dissection. (Fuster, p. 1178)
27. (D) This pulse is seen in aortic regurgitation.

The pressure in diastole is usually 50 mm Hg or lower. This is known as a water hammer or Corrigan's pulse. A bisferiens pulse (in the bisferiens wave form there are two pressure peaks) may be present as well. Systolic blood pressure is elevated. (Fuster, p. 1654)
28. (B) Digoxin toxicity may cause any dysrhythmia. Classically, dysrhythmias that are associated with increased automaticity and decreased AV conduction occur (i.e., paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block, accelerated junctional rhythm, or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia [torsade de pointes]). Sinus bradycardiaand other bradyarrhythmias are very common. Slow atrial fibrillation with very little variation in the ventricular rate (regularization of the $R$ R interval) may occur. This arrhythmia is likely slow atrial fibrillation. Symptoms of digitalis toxicity include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, and visual disturbances. The presence of hypokalemia increases the likelihood of digitalis toxicity. (Fuster, p. 795)
29. (A) Commonly, no cause is found for constrictive pericarditis. Some patients do give a history of previous acute pericarditis. TB is now an uncommon cause. Cancer can cause constriction but is uncommon. Rheumatic fever does not cause pericarditis. (Fuster, pp. 1989-1991)
30. (E) The maneuvers listed increase the block and are useful for diagnosis, but not for converting the atrial flutter to a sinus rhythm. Electrical cardioversion is the method of choice in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. Often very low amounts of energy during cardioversion will convert atrial flutter. (Fuster, p. 844)
31. (C) Atrial flutter is characterized by regular atrial activation with an atrial rate of $>240$ beats/ min . The ventricular response depends on the conduction of the AV node, usually there is 2:1 or 3:1 conduction. It is now known that the predominant mechanism for atrial flutter is right atrial macroreentry with circular activation. Atrial flutter typically originates from the right atrium and most often involves a large circuit that travels around the area of the tricuspid valve. This type of atrial flutter is referred to as typical atrial flutter. Less commonly, atrial flutter can result from circuits in other areas of the right or left atrium. (Fuster, pp. 841-842)
32. (B) Retention of fluid is complex and not due to any one factor, however, hormones may contribute. Growth hormone does not have fluidretaining properties. The exact mechanisms that initiate renal conservation of salt and water are not precisely understood, but may include arterial volume receptors sensing a decrease in the effective arterial blood volume. Aldosterone, renin, and vasopressin are generally increased in heart failure. (Fuster, p. 713)
33. (A) ST elevation persisting 2 weeks after an infarct, an abnormal pericardial impulse, and a bulge on the left ventricular border on x-ray are characteristic of an aneurysm. Ventricular aneurysms are most often a result of a large anterior infarct. The poor prognosis associated with these aneurysms is due to the associated left ventricular dysfunction, rather than to the aneurysm itself. (Fuster, pp. 1321-1322)
34. (D) In aortic stenosis, there is normal overall cardiac size, but dilatation of the proximal ascending aorta and blunt rounding of the lower left cardiac contour. Calcification of the valve is often difficult to determine on plain films. Although left atrial enlargement can occur, its presence on the CXR should raise other diagnostic possibilities, such as mitral valve disease. (Fuster, p. 1647)
35. (D) This combination, although the total cholesterol is borderline, has high HDL cholesterol, which is protective. Nevertheless, a level this high would likely require treatment. (Fuster, pp. 1099-1100)
36. (B) Besides coarctation of the aorta, aortic occlusive disease, dissection of the aorta, and abdominal aneurysm may lead to differential blood pressure in arms and legs. Coarctation is the third most common form of congenital cardiac disease. One-third of the patients will be hypertensive. The femoral pulses are weak, delayed, and even absent. (Fuster, p. 1809)
37. (D) He likely has LVH.

Signs include left axis deviation, highvoltage QRS complexes in V5 and V6, deep S in V1 and V2, and prolonged QRS in the left precordial leads. Age, orientation of the heart in the chest, and noncardiac factors make the ECG an imperfect tool for diagnosing or excluding LVH. The ECG is more accurate and better for following progression or regression of LVH. (Fuster, pp. 311-312)
38. (A) High urinary specific gravity, nocturia, and daytime oliguria occur in addition to low urinary sodium content in untreated CHF. These changes are the result of the activation of therenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. (Fuster, pp. 713-714)
39. (C) Thyroid disease may affect the heart muscle directly or there may be excessive sympathetic stimulation. Common symptoms of thyrotoxic heart disease include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, and worsening angina. Atrial fibrillation is particularly common in older individuals. (Fuster, p. 827)
40. (D) Since the duration of atrial fibrillation is not known, it is presumed to be chronic. There is an increased risk of cardioembolic events if restoration of sinus rhythm is attempted before anticoagulating the patient for 3-4 weeks. Aspirin is only modestly effective in reducing cardioembolic events and not the first choice. Beta-blockers are not indicated since the rate is controlled. (Fuster, pp. 833-834)
41. (B) Cotton wool spots, hemorrhage, and papilledema are common. Fibrinoid necrosis occurs on the arterioles of many organs. Earlier manifestations of arteriosclerosis include thickening of the vessel wall. This is manifested by obscuring of the venous column at arterial crossings. (Fuster, p. 1541, 1543)
42. (A) Early atherosclerosis with tendon xanthomas, xanthelasma, and arcus senilis are characteristics of familial hypercholesterolemia. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. (Fuster, pp. 236-237)
43. (C) Acute pericarditis is most often idiopathic and is typically self-limited (usually within 2-6 weeks). While small effusions are common, tamponade is unusual, as are heart failure and constriction. Other diseases causing pericarditis should be searched for, and may influence the prognosis. (Fuster, p. 1982)
44. (D) Orthostatic hypotension (systolic dropping by 20 mm or more) is particularly common in the elderly and in diabetics because of autonomic neuropathy. Management includes avoidance of precipitating factors, simple adaptive maneuvers, volume expansion, and pharmacologic agents. (Fuster, pp. 1036-1037)
45. (E) In mitral valve prolapse, the first heart sound is usually preserved followed by a systolic click and late systolic murmur. The click is actually the most common finding. General physical examination may reveal scoliosis, pectus excavatum, straightened thoracic spine, or narrow anteroposterior diameter of chest. (Fuster, p. 1698)
46. (A) The symptoms and signs are like any sudden paroxysmal tachycardia, but the ventricular rate is the clue, after carotid pressure, to the diagnosis of atrial flutter with 2:1 block. (Fuster, pp. 841-842)
47. (C) Management of acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis includes analgesia (usually aspirin every 3-4 hours initially) and rest if the pain is severe. Occasionally, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are required (e.g., ibuprofen or indomethacin). Careful observation for increasing effusion and tamponade are essential. The classic findings of cardiac tamponade include arterial hypotension and pulsus paradoxus. (Fuster, p. 1985)
48. (B) Diastolic dysfunction is an important cause of heart failure in the elderly. It is commonly associated with a history of hypertension and diabetes. Normal ejection fraction and aortic sclerosis rule out either systolic or valvular heart disease as causes. In HOCM there is nonconcentric hypertrophy. (Fuster, pp. 710, 2276-2277)
49. (A) Acute rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque is now recognized as the most common cause of ST-elevation MI. Pericarditis has diffuse ST elevation in multiple leads and aortic stenosis does cause angina but not ST elevation. (Fuster, p. 1226)
50. (D) S. epidermidis is still the most frequent early and late cause of endocarditis in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The other organisms are seen less frequently in late prosthetic valve endocarditis. (Fuster, pp. 2004-2005)
51. (D) This man has acute coronary syndrome (ACS) until proven otherwise. The ECG is themost useful initial investigation since it identifies individuals with ST-segment elevation who may be candidates for either thrombolysis or primary angioplasty (PCI). The troponins are important in diagnosing myocardial necrosis. The other investigations may be important in looking for alternate causes of chest pain once ST-elevation MI has been ruled out. (Fuster, pp. 1252, 1256)
52. (C) Essential hypertension is the most likely diagnosis. A secondary cause for hypertension is found in only $10 \%$ of patients, with $90 \%$ labeled as essential. Current recommendations for initial workup of a hypertensive patient include serum chemistry (glucose, potassium, creatinine), urinalysis, and ECG. (Fuster, p. 1545)
53. (C) Coarctation of the aorta is the diagnosis.

There is a reverse 3 deformity of the esophagus, the belly of which represents the dilated aorta after the coarctation. The border of the descending aorta shows a medial indentation called the 3 or tuck sign, the belly of the 3 representing the poststenotic dilation and the upper portion by the dilated subclavian artery and small transverse aortic arch. (Fuster, p. 1809)
54. (B) Note the abnormal humped contour of the left ventricular border, with a curvilinear calcification following the abnormal cardiac contour. The presence of calcification in the ventricular wall and the abnormal left ventricular contour alerts one to the consideration of a ventricular aneurysm. (Fuster, pp. 1321-1322)
55. (B) The cardiac rhythm is atrial flutter with 2:1 AV conduction. QRS complexes occur with perfect regularity at a rate of about $150 / \mathrm{min}$. Their normal contour and duration indicate that ventricular activation occurs normally via the AV junction-His-Purkinje system. (Fuster, pp. 841-842)
56. (B) The PR interval of the first two complexes is normal at 0.20 seconds. The QRS duration is 0.16 seconds. The third $P$ wave is nonconducted. This cycle recurs in the remainder of the strip. This is second-degree heart block of the Mobitz type II variety. Note the wide QRS.

When this type of heart block develops, either de novo or in the course of an AMI, a cardiac pacemaker is usually recommended, as the incidence of complete heart block is high in this situation. (Fuster, pp. 901-903)
57. (D) The ST is depressed in leads II, III, aVF, and V4-V6. These nonspecific abnormalities do not indicate significant coronary heart disease, especially in an apprehensive young patient. Further evaluations should be guided by clinical circumstances. (Fuster, pp. 304-305)
58. (E) The underlying rhythm is a regular sinus rhythm with a rate of 85 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$. The sinus rhythm is interrupted frequently by bursts of irregular ventricular, premature beats. The sinus rhythm is uninterrupted as can be determined by plotting the PP intervals, which are regular.

The rhythm may be termed a chaotic ventricular arrhythmia or ventricular tachycardia. Its gross irregularity is unusual. Antiarrhythmic therapy is usually not indicated for nonsustained VT in the setting of thrombolytic treatment. (Fuster, pp. 876-877)
59. (A) No atrial activity is detected. The ventricular rate is slightly irregular. Beat number 4 is a ventricular premature contraction. The T waves are tall and markedly peaked. This type of T wave is characteristic of hyperkalemia, as is absence of visible atrial activity.

The potassium level was $8.2 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. (Fuster, p. 313)
60. (A) Sudden death, defined as death within 1 hour of onset of symptoms, is usually caused by cardiac disease in middle-aged and elderly patients, but in younger age groups noncardiac causes predominate. There is a bimodal distribution in the population, with the first peak before 6 months of age (sudden infant death syndrome). The most common coronary artery finding is extensive chronic coronary atherosclerosis, although acute syndromes do occur. (Fuster, p. 1057)
61. (B) Over $90 \%$ of hypertensives in the general population have essential hypertension. Onlyabout $60 \%$ of hypertensives are very sensitive to salt. About $20 \%$ of hypertensives have low-renin essential hypertension. This is more common in Blacks. Male sex, Black race, youth, smoking, DM, excess alcohol ingestion, hypercholesterolemia, more severe hypertension, and evidence of end-organ damage are among the factors that suggest a poor prognosis. (Kasper, pp. 1463-1464)
62. (B, G, H, I) In renal impairment, potassiumsparing diuretics can cause life-threatening hyperkalemia. The characteristic findings of hyperkalemia are a narrow-based, peaked $T$ wave in conjunction with a widened QRS complex. Other causes of widened QRS complexes do not coexist with a narrow-peak T wave. Also, the PR interval prolongs and the P wave flattens with hyperkalemia. (Fuster, p. 313)
63. (D) With severe hypercalcemia, the QT interval is markedly shortened. There is a correlation between the length of QT interval and the degree of hypercalcemia. (Fuster, p. 314)
64. (C) Hypokalemia results in prolongation of the QU interval. The delayed repolarization in hypokalemia is best expressed at QU rather than QT prolongation since it can be difficult to separate the $T$ wave from the $U$ wave. In severe cases, the ST segments become depressed. Quinidine, even in therapeutic doses, can cause similar ECG findings. This is felt to be a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades des pointes. (Fuster, p. 314)
65. (A, E, G, J) Hypovolemic shock is characterized by a low cardiac output with normal or high systemic vascular resistance. The low right atrial filling pressure and low PA wedge pressure reflect the inadequate venous return. (Kasper, p. 1615)
66. (C, D, F, G, J, K) This man has a right ventricular MI. Primary right ventricular failure is characterized by a disproportionately high right atrial pressure with normal or high wedge pressure. The PA diastolic pressure is normal or elevated and the gradient between PA diastolic pressure and wedge pressure is usually
increased. Systemic vascular resistance is usually normal. (Kasper, p. 1615)
67. (A, D, E, H, I, K) In septic shock, right atrial wedge pressures, and systemic vascular resistance are low. PA diastolic pressure is usually normal or high, therefore, resulting in an increased gradient between PA diastolic and wedge pressures. Cardiac output can be normal or high in early sepsis. (Kasper, p. 1615)
68. (C, F, G, J, K) Cardiogenic shock is characterized by high right atrial pressure (although it can be normal at times), high PA wedge pressure, high PA diastolic pressure, high systemic vascular resistance, and low cardiac output. (Kasper, p. 1615)
69. (A, D, E) In chronic, compensated mitral regurgitation, there is a holosystolic murmur, which starts with S1 and extends to or past the aortic component of S2. The S1 is diminished, and there is increased splitting of S2.

This condition is often tolerated for years before symptoms develop. (Fuster, p. 1686)
70. (B, C, F) CAD is the most common cause of acute mitral regurgitation in the United States. The murmur is often midsystolic early on, and a thrill may be present. The apex is usually hyperdynamic but actual forward stroke volume is usually diminished. The presentation is usually dominated by acute pulmonary edema and occurs most often 2-7 days post-MI. (Fuster, pp. 1680-1682)
71. (B) ECG changes in mitral stenosis are due to enlargement and hypertrophy of the left atrium and asynchronous atrial activation.

The notched $P$ wave is most prominent in lead II. In lead V1, the P wave has a negative terminal deflection. (Fuster, p. 1673)
72. (A) A prolonged PR interval is a common finding in asymptomatic elderly patients that have age-related degeneration of the AV node. Drugs such as beta-blockers (metoprolol) may exacerbate the condition or even cause PR prolongation in excessive doses. (Fuster, p. 901)73. (D) In Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the PR interval is short, the QRS is widened, and there is slurring of the upstroke of the R wave. The shortened PR interval reflects faster than normal conduction through an accessory pathway. The ventricular complex represents a fusion beat. The blurred upstroke of the QRS (delta wave) represents ventricular activation via the accessory pathway. The normal end portion of the QRS represents activation via the normal route through the AV node. (Fuster, p. 865)
74. (C) Hypercalcemia may prolong the QRS and shorten the ST and QT intervals. Serious arrhythmias rarely occur with hypercalcemia. (Fuster, p. 314)
75. (E) The ECG in severe aortic stenosis shows LVH, but is not perfectly sensitive and is not specific. Bundle branch blocks and ST-T changes can occur, but some patients have a normal ECG. (Fuster, p. 1647)
76. (C) Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are both indicated in the treatment of heart failure patients with systolic dysfunction. (Fuster, p. 729)
77. (A) Beta-blockers have a negative inotropic effect on the heart. Despite this they improve survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (Fuster, p. 733)
78. (A) In chronic atrial flutter, control of ventricular rate is the goal of therapy. Beta-blockers, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2}+$ calcium channel blockers, and digoxin are drugs commonly used. (Fuster, pp. 836-837)
79. (D) Neither ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers mediate their effects by calcium channel blockade. (Brunton, pp. 272, 800)
80. (A, E, I, J) Hydralazine has a greater dilator effect on arterioles than on veins, the opposite is true for nitrates. Combined therapy with hydralazine and nitrates has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure, but not reduce hospitalization for heart failure. Reflex tachycardia with hydralazine is common in patients with hypertension, but less so in heart failure. Tachycardia may precipitate
angina. Calcium channel blockers are not generally used in CHF, because of their negative inotropic effect. However, amlodipine can be used for concurrent treatment of angina or hypertension. (Fuster, pp. 730-738)
81. (B) Enalapril may exert its effect by inhibiting formation of angiotensin II. This lowers systemic vascular resistance. In addition, ACE inhibitors have a natriuretic effect by inhibition of aldosterone secretion. They have been shown to improve mortality and decrease hospitalization in patients with CHF. (Fuster, pp. 730-738)
82. (F) Digoxin is a direct inotropic agent, but is usually reserved for patients who are symptomatic after treatment with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. It can be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, although beta-blockers might be preferred. (Fuster, p. 741)
83. (E) Long-acting nifedipine has been a useful adjunct to the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension, but great care must be used as even low doses of vasodilators can cause untoward reactions in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Lung transplants have provided a major therapeutic modality for managing severe pulmonary hypertension.
ACE inhibitors and hydralazine have been tried, but are not effective. (Fuster, p. 1788)
84. (D) There are numerous potential mechanisms that might explain the beneficial effects of betablockers in left ventricular dysfunction, and post-MI. The benefit is additive to that provided by ACE inhibitors. (Fuster, p. 733)
85. (C) A hyperkinetic pulse occurs in the setting of an elevated stroke volume (anemia, fever, anxiety) or an abnormally rapid runoff from the arterial system (aortic regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus, arteriovenous fistula). (Fuster, p. 244)
86. (E) A dicrotic pulse has a peak in systole and another in diastole. It occurs in patients with very low stroke volume, especially dilated cardiomyopathy. (Fuster, p. 244)87. (D) The bisferiens pulse, two systolic peaks, occurs in HOCM and aortic regurgitation. In aortic regurgitation, the bisferiens pulse can occur both in the presence or absence of aortic stenosis. (Fuster, p. 224)
88. (A) The pulsus tardus of aortic stenosis is the result of mechanical obstruction to left ventricular ejection and often has an accompanying thrill. The characteristic feel of the pulse is caused by a delayed systolic peak. (Fuster, p. 244)
89. (B) Pulsus paradoxus, a drop of $>10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in systolic blood pressure during inspiration, is caused by pericardial tamponade, airway obstruction, or superior vena cava obstruction. At times, the peripheral pulse may disappear completely during inspiration. (Fuster, p. 245)
90. (E) Tricuspid regurgitation increases the size of the $v$ wave. When tricuspid regurgitation becomes severe, the combination of a prominent $v$ wave and obliteration of the $x$ descent results in a single, large, positive systolic wave. (Fuster, p. 248)
91. (D) Right atrial myxoma, or tricuspid stenosis, will slow the $y$ descent by obstructing right ventricular filling. The $y$ descent of the JVP is produced mainly by the tricuspid valve opening and the subsequent rapid inflow of blood into the right ventricle. (Fuster, p. 248)
92. (C) Right ventricular infarction and constrictive pericarditis frequently result in an increase in JVP during inspiration (Kussmaul's sign). Severe right-sided failure can also be a cause. (Fuster, p. 247)
93. (F) Right-sided heart failure is the most common cause of a positive abdominojugular reflux (normal JVP at rest, increases during 10 seconds of firm midabdominal compression, and only drops when pressure is released). (Fuster, p. 247)
94. (A) Large $a$ waves occur with increased resistance to filling (tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary hypertension) or when the right atrium contracts against a tricuspid valve closed by right
ventricular systole (Cannon a waves) in complete heart block or other arrhythmias. (Fuster, p. 248)
95. (E) With standing, most murmurs diminish. The two exceptions are HOCM, which becomes louder, and mitral valve prolapse, which becomes longer and louder. (Kasper, pp. 1308-1310)
96. (A) With the Valsalva maneuver, most murmurs will decrease. The exceptions are the murmurs of HOCM and mitral valve prolapse, which increase.

After release of the Valsalva maneuver, right-sided murmurs tend to return to baseline more rapidly. (Kasper, pp. 1308-1310)
97. (B) The murmur of HOCM often decreases with submaximal isometric exercise (handgrip). Murmurs across normal or obstructed valves will be increased.

Handgrip can also accentuate an S3 or S4. (Kasper, pp. 1308-1310)
98. (B) HOCM often has a bisferiens pulse. It can also be found in pure aortic regurgitation or combined aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. (Kasper, pp. 1308-1310)
99. (C) This maneuver will increase the murmurs of mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, and aortic regurgitation. Other murmurs are not affected. (Kasper, pp. 1308-1310)
100. (B) Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by a prominent y descent of the neck veins and low voltage on ECG. The presence of a positive Kussmaul's sign helps differentiate the syndrome from cor pulmonale and restrictive cardiomyopathies. (Fuster, p. 1990)
101. (A) Cardiac tamponade can occur with as little as 200 mL of fluid if the accumulation is rapid. Physical examination reveals a pulsus paradoxus ( $>10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ inspiratory decline in systolic arterial pressure), a prominent x descent of the jugular veins, but no Kussmaul's sign. The ECG may show low voltage. (Fuster, p. 1985)102. (D) RVMI is characterized by high neck veins, ECG abnormalities, and often a right-sided S3. The low cardiac output associated with RVMI can often be treated by volume expansion. Although a third of patients with inferoposterior infarctions have some degree of right ventricular necrosis, extensive RVMI is uncommon. (Fuster, p. 1281)
103. (A) Electrical alternans (a beat-to-beat alternation in one or more component of the ECG signal) can occur in pericardial effusion and numerous other conditions. Total electrical alternans (P-QRS-T) and sinus tachycardia is relatively specific for pericardial effusion (often with tamponade). (Fuster, p. 1985)
104. (B) A pericardial knock is characteristic of constrictive pericarditis. It is in fact an early S3, occurring 0.06-0.12 seconds after aortic closure. S1 and S2 are frequently distant. (Fuster, p. 1990)
105. (C) The combination of absent pulsus and absent Kussmaul's sign with prominent x descent favors a restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Unlike constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathies frequently present with an enlarged heart, orthopnea, LVH, and bundle branch blocks. (Fuster, pp. 1937-1938)
106. (C) The cardiac lesions of gastrointestinal carcinoids are almost exclusively in the right side of the heart and occur only when there are hepatic metastases. Fibrous plaques are found on the endothelium of the cardiac chambers, valves, and great vessels. These plaques can distort cardiac valves; tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic stenosis are the most common valvular problems. (Kasper, pp. 1423-1424)
107. (B) The proximal aortitis of seronegative arthritis (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, or associated with inflammatory bowel disease) can result in aortic regurgitation and AV block. (Kasper, p. 1424)
108. (A) Focal myocardial necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration caused by high circulating levels of catecholamines are seen in about $50 \%$ of patients who die with pheochromocytoma.

Hypertension can further impair left ventricular function. (Kasper, p. 1424)
109. (D) The Means-Lerman scratch, a systolic scratchy sound heard at the left second intercostal space during expiration, is thought to result from the rubbing of the hyperdynamic pericardium against the pleura. Palpitations, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, angina, and heart failure are more common cardiac manifestations of hyperthyroidism. (Kasper, p. 1423)
110. (E) DM can result in a restrictive cardiomyopathy in the absence of large-vessel CAD. Histology reveals increased collagen, glycoprotein, triglycerides, and cholesterol in the myocardial interstitium. Abnormalities may be present in small intramural arteries. (Kasper, p. 1422)
111. (D, E) Patients with diabetes have the same rates of coronary heart disease events as patients with established CAD. Therefore diabetes is now considered a coronary heart disease, equivalent when assessing risk even if the patient has not had any previous cardiac symptoms. The current guidelines support risk reduction efforts (both lifestyle and drug therapy) in patients with diabetes similar to those recommended for patients with CAD (secondary prevention). The goal for LDL is $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in patients with diabetes and secondary goals include considering fibrates for those with high triglycerides and nicotinic acid for low HDL cholesterol. Lifestyle modification is recommended for everyone irrespective of risk. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
112. (E) When assessing patients for cardiovascular risk, it is always important to consider recommendations in light of their risk level. For primary prevention (no known symptomatic CAD), there are risk calculators available to estimate an individual's future risk (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/for a risk calculator based on the Framingham database). The treatment recommendations and goals should match the patient's risk level. In this individual, she has no risk factors for CAD and her 10-year risk for cardiovascular events is low. The goals for LDL in her are$<160 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, and drug therapy should be only considered if her LDL $>190 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. For her, the best advice is lifestyle modification such as dietary modification, exercise, and weight loss if indicated since these changes will lower triglycerides, raise HDL, and lower LDL. Repeat screening is recommended every 5 years. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
113. (D, E) For patients with established CAD, their future risk for further cardiovascular events is high (10-year risk $>20 \%$ ). In such individuals, the goals of LDL level are adjusted lower to match the increased risk. For secondary prevention, the LDL level target is $<100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. For all individuals at increased risk-lifestyle modification is stressed as a key component therapy. In this patient given, the recent diagnosis of CAD and the elevated LDL level treatment with a "statin" is also indicated. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
114. (D, E) Recent evidence has suggested that lipid modification for patients with ischemic stroke (that is not cardioembolic in origin) by lowering LDL level with statins is beneficial in reducing future stroke risk. This evidence comes from the analysis of cardiovascular statin trials that have a lower rate of ischemic strokes in patients taking the medication as compared to the placebo group. In addition, lifestyle modification is important for this individual especially smoking cessation. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
115. (D, E) The metabolic syndrome is frequently identified among individuals given the increasing rates of obesity and diabetes in Western society. This individual has multiple atherogenic risk factors (obesity, hypertension, increased LDL) and his 10-year risk for cardiac events is approximated at $10-20 \%$ by the risk calculator. At this risk level, the LDL goal is $<130 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ and treatment threshold for starting drug therapy is $>130 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. As well lifestyle modification is an important component of the overall treatment. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
116. (E) Many observational studies have verified the increased risk of CAD in women after menopause, and this formed the basis for
recommending estrogen therapy to lower cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Recently two large randomized clinical trials have shown no benefit with estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women as a means of reducing cardiovascular risk. With this evidence, estrogen replacement is not recommended for cardiac risk modification, and is only indicated to treat the symptoms of menopause. For postmenopausal women at increased risk of cardiac disease, statins are considered first-line therapy in modifying risk since there are randomized trial data from multiple trials supporting their effectiveness in women. Since this patient has only one risk factor her future 10-year risk is low ( $<10 \%$ ) and lifestyle modification is the best advice. She will require follow-up lipid risk assessment in 5 years. (Kasper, pp. 1430-1433)
117. (G) ACE inhibitors have no adverse effects on glucose or lipid metabolism and minimize the development of diabetic nephropathy by reducing renal vascular resistance and renal perfusion pressure. The goal for blood pressure control in diabetics is set at $130 / 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ which is lower than in nondiabetics. This lower pressure is important in preventing progression of renal disease and other end-organ damage. (Kasper, p. 1479)
118. (A) Thiazides have been a cornerstone in most trials of antihypertensive therapy. Their adverse metabolic consequences include renal potassium loss leading to hypokalemia, hyperuricemia from uric acid retention, carbohydrate intolerance, and hyperlipidemia. The current U.S. Joint National Committee (JNC-7) guidelines suggest starting with thiazide diuretics because of their proven efficacy in lowering mortality and morbidity in large clinical trials. Other agents are considered if there are comorbidities such as diabetes or CAD. (Kasper, pp. 1472, 1478)
119. (G) Although contraindicated in bilateral stenosis, ACE inhibitors are the drug of choice in unilateral renal artery stenosis.

When ACE inhibitors are used in patients with impaired renal function, renalfunction should be monitored twice a week for the first 3 weeks. (Kasper, p. 1479)
120. (A) Thiazides seem to work particularly well in Blacks and the elderly. Younger individuals and Whites respond well to beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel antagonists. Isolated systolic hypertension is a common occurance in the elderly. It is due to arteriosclerosis of the large arteries. Treatment of isolated systolic hypertension with low-dose thiazides results in lower stroke rates and death. The goal
for treatment is a blood pressure of $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg. (Kasper, pp. 1471, 1480)
121. (E) Beta-blockers are the most appropriate choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with CAD. They lower mortality in patients with CAD as well as hypertension. ACE inhibitors can also be used, especially if there is left ventricular dysfunction, or the patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes or dyslipidemia.

1. (A) Koebner phenomenon is typically seen in psoriasis. The kind of injury eliciting the phenomenon is usually mechanical, but ultraviolet light or allergic damage to the skin may be provocative. Koebner phenomenon can also occur in lichen planus, lichen nitidus, keratosis follicularis, and pemphigoid. The Koebner phenomenon has been used to study early skin changes in these diseases. (Wolff, p. 54)
2. (G) Kaposi sarcoma often manifests as multiple blue dermal plaques. Lesions have two prominent features: accumulation of spindle cells and presence of vascular elements. Classical Kaposi sarcoma is an indolent disease of later life and is much more common in men than women. Kaposi sarcoma in association with HIV infection is a much more aggressive disorder. In all types of Kaposi the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of human herpes virus 8 has been identified. (Wolff, p. 536)
3. (F, K, L) Psoriasis does not present a progression of lesions unless therapy is applied. Lesions vary in size and configuration from patient to patient and in the same patient from time to time and vary from drop-shaped lesions to large plaques. Nail changes are characteristic. (Wolff, p. 54)
4. (B, C, G) In dermatomyositis, the dermatitis may be the most striking feature of the illness or so minor as to be easily overlooked. The classic manifestation is a purplish-red heliotrope erythema of the eyelids, upper cheeks, forehead, and temples, often with edema of the eyelids and of the periorbital tissue. Telangiectasia and skin atrophy can also
occur. The typical hand changes involve scaly, bluish-red plaques around the base of the nails and backs of the joints of the fingers. These are most frequently found in elderly patients and are called Gottron's papules. There is an association with malignancy in those over 55 years of age. (Wolff, p. 372)
5. (E) The history should not reveal worsening eruption during the weekend. Allergy, acne, diabetes, psoriasis, xeroderma, or seborrheic dermatitis may all be mistaken for occupational disorders. The list of possible occupational skin hazards is long. At times, a site visit to the workplace is required to confirm the diagnosis. First aid in the workplace often involves sensitizing agents that worsen the situation. Skin problems can be severe and permanent. Relatively few patients are malingerers. (Wolff, p. 24)
6. (D) A change of environment is among the best treatments for atopic dermatitis. The patient should be kept in as dust-free an environment as possible and should not wear rough garments. Maintenance of adequate humidity is also important. (Wolff, p. 33)
7. (A) This tumor as a rule occurs on exposed, hairy skin. It grows rapidly but involutes slowly, occasionally up to 1 year. It is more common in white-skinned males. The lesion starts as a small, rounded, flesh-colored or reddish papule. It grows rapidly and may reach $10-20 \mathrm{~mm}$ in a few weeks. There are telangiectasias just below the surface and the center contains a horny plug or is covered by a crust concealing a keratin-filled crater. Histology canbe difficult to differentiate from squamous cell cancer. (Wolff, p. 208)
8. (C) There are antibodies to skin basement membrane, but unlike pemphigus, antibody levels do not correlate with disease activity. Bullous pemphigoid is most common in the elderly, and the disease often starts with urticaria-like and pruritic erythematous lesions, before classic blisters occur. The blisters arise from inflamed and normal skin, unlike in pemphigus where they arise from normal skin. As well, unlike pemphigus, mucosal lesions are minimal or absent. (Wolff, p. 106)
9. (A) Patients with acanthosis nigricans should be studied for a visceral carcinoma. There are hereditary, drug-induced, and benign forms of acanthosis nigricans as well. Given this patient's symptoms a gastric malignancy should be ruled out. Diabetics get a benign form of the disorder. Other dermatoses associated with malignancy include dermatomyositis, flushing, acquired ichthyosis, and thrombophlebitis migrans. (Wolff, p. 86)
10. (A) Ointments are not used, but wet dressings are applied several times a day, using Burow's solution or boric acid, and baths are also included in the treatment. The key aspect of care is prevention. When contamination does occur, washing the affected area is the first mode of treatment. Oral corticosteroids are only used in severe cases. In less severe cases, topical class I glucocorticoid preparations can be helpful. (Wolff, p. 23)
11. (A) Ringworm of the skin is most common in children because of their intimacy with animals and other children. The lesions are round or oval scaly patches. Secondary bacterial infection is common with certain fungi. (Wolff, p. 707)
12. (A) Verrucae are viral in etiology. The human papillomavirus is a DNA-containing virus of the papovavirus group that includes animal tumor viruses. Although most warts are not felt to be premalignant; there is evidence to show that genital warts are correlated with malignancy. (Wolff, p. 776)
13. (C) This is likely a case of primary syphilis. Serology is the most appropriate test; it can remain negative for a period up to 1 month after the infection is contracted. The serologic test for syphilis usually is positive within 1 week after the chancre appears. With therapy the chancre heals rapidly, but will heal in 4-6 weeks even without treatment. Genital chancres are usually painless, unless superinfected, but extragenital chancres (e.g., fingers) can be quite painful. Biopsy is usually not necessary for diagnosis, and the spirochetes are seen with dark-field examination, not with Gram stain. (Wolff, p. 915)
14. (D) In bullous pemphigoid, biopsy reveals immunoglobulin $G(\mathrm{IgG})$ deposits in the basement membrane area. In pemphigus vulgaris, the immune deposition and damage is within the lower zone of the epidermis. IgA deposits are seen in dermatitis herpetiformis. (Wolff, p. 106)
15. (C) About $15 \%$ of patients with ulcerative colitis will develop skin manifestations. Typical lesions include erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum (painless, but can heal with scarring), aphthous ulcers, and ocular inflammation (episcleritis, iritis, uveitis). The activity of the skin manifestations typically parallels the severity of the colonic disease. (Wolff, p. 148)
16. (C) Mycosis fungoides is best described as a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lesions may remain confined to the skin for years, and internal organ involvement occurs when the disease advances into late stages. It is a disorder involving T lymphocytes. Treatment is usually palliative rather than curative. (Wolff, p. 528)
17. (C) Rhinophyma is a complication of rosacea. It can be treated surgically by shaving off the excessive tissue with a scalpel, but regrowth occurs in time. There is very little evidence to support the association between alcoholism and rhinophyma. The other conditions do not cause flushing or blushing-type appearance. Psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis have lesions that have white dry scales. (Wolff, pp. 8-10)18. (D) Glossitis and cheilitis result from the vitamin deficiency affecting rapidly turning over tissues. Patients may complain of a "burning" tongue, and examination reveals atrophy of papillae, a deep red mucosa, and a "cobblestone" appearance. Vitamin $B_{12}$ administration rapidly relieves these symptoms. The vitiligo is caused by an associated autoimmune disorder. (Kasper, pp. 603-604)
19. (C) The description and age range (60-80) is typical of bullous pemphigoid. PV is usually associated with a positive Nikolsky's sign (pressure on blister leads to lateral extension), and very severe oral lesions. Cicatricial pemphigoid is also a disease of the elderly, but is rare and usually involves the eyes as well. EB is an inherited disorder that usually presents in earlier life. DH does not usually affect mucous membranes, and the lesions are grouped in clusters. However, it can mimic early bullous pemphigoid, and biopsy is needed for confirmation. Permanent remission is frequent, and continued therapy would not be required. (Wolff, pp. 106-108)
20. (D) PV is most common from 40 to 60 years of age, whereas bullous pemphigoid is seen most frequently after the age of 80 . Dermatitis herpetiformis is most common in the age group from 30 to 40 , but has a wide age range. (Wolff, p. 100).
21. (B) Captopril and other drugs can cause PV, but D-penicillamine is the most likely to cause the disease. Drug-induced PV usually, but not invariably, remits when the offending agent is withdrawn. (Wolff, p. 103)
22. (A, C, H) Neurofibromatosis is inherited in an autosomal manner. Incomplete forms are frequent. The skin manifestations include café au lait spots (more than six required for diagnosis), axillary freckles, cutaneous neurofibromas, and pigmented iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules). There are numerous other manifestations as well including neural tumors. (Wolff, p. 464)
23. (A, B, D) Early recognition of acanthosis nigricans warrants a thorough search for underlying
pathology such as malignancy or insulin resistance. The earliest changes are usually pigmentation, dryness, and roughness of the skin. The skin is gray brown or black, palpably thickened, and covered by small papillomatous elevations, which give it a velvety texture. The most common sites are axillae, back, neck, anogenital region, and the groin. (Wolff, p. 86)
24. (A) Basal cell tumors have a substantial capacity for local destruction but metastasize very rarely. (Wolff, p. 282)
25. (C, K) Both squamous cell cancer and melanoma can spread beyond the skin. Only about $3-4 \%$ of squamous cell cancers metastasize, but metastasis is quite common in melanoma. Melanoma is the most dangerous primary skin cancer. (Wolff, pp. 278, 303)
26. (A, K) In both squamous and basal cell carcinomas, early detection may lead to cure by surgical removal. Radiotherapy may be curative, but is usually reserved for cases where surgery is not feasible, or likely to be disfiguring. (Wolff, pp. 278, 282)
27. (H) Mongolian spots are congenital gray blue macular lesions, characteristically located on the lumbosacral area, although they can occur anywhere on the skin. They are almost always (99-100\%) in infants of Asiatic or Amerindian origin, although reports in Black, and rarely, White infants have occurred. They usually disappear in early childhood, and generally the lesions are solitary. (Wolff, p. 176)
28. (K) Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can arise in areas of inflammation such as burn scars, chronic ulcers, radiation dermatitis, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosis. Other early lesions include solar keratoses, cutaneous horns, arsenical keratoses, and Bowen's disease. (Wolff, p. 276)
29. (E) Bullous pemphigoid is most common in older adults. It is not as severe as pemphigus vulgaris, and histology reveals an absence of acantholysis, and immunofluorescence revealsspecific antibodies in the basement membrane area. (Wolff, p. 106)
30. (E) Tetracyclines are commonly used in the treatment of moderate acne, but may be associated with risk of dental discoloration or photosensitivity. Isotretinoin is the most effective drug for severe acne, but is teratogenic, and may cause lipid abnormalities, hepatoxicity, and night blindness. It cannot be combined with tetracycline because of the risk of pseudotumor cerebri. (Wolff, p. 6)
31. (C) Exfoliative dermatitis is a rare skin condition, but because of its severity, patients with this syndrome are often admitted to a hospital. The syndrome can be primary, appearing in otherwise healthy individuals, or secondary to malignancy, contact dermatitis, drugs, or other dermatologic diseases (e.g., psoriasis). Even mild cases require systemic treatment for the severe itching. Antihistamines are usually the first choice. (Wolff, pp. 158-163)
32. (E) Most cases of exfoliative dermatitis will have widespread lymphadenopathy, whether they are primary or secondary forms. Biopsy will usually reveal nonspecific changes and is only warranted if there is a suspicion of lymphoma. (Wolff, p. 160)
33. (C) These large cells are typical of Sézary syndrome, a leukemic form of cutaneus T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). This is frequently an early presentation of mycosis fungoides or CTCL. There may be a relationship to human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I and II, but it is not universal. CTCL is a malignancy of helper T cells $\left(\mathrm{CD}^{4+}\right)$. (Wolff, p. 528)
34. (D) The typical course of mycosis fungoides is an initial erythematous stage (which might become diffuse and cause an exfoliative dermatitis as in this case), a plaque stage, and a tumor stage. The course is usually progressive through these stages, but all stages can be bypassed. The early stages may progress slowly with remissions or exacerbations. The disease can be rapidly progressive, particularly
when the tumor stage is reached. The disease is invariably fatal. (Wolff, p. 530)
35. (D) There is no curative therapy, and most experts provide treatment only when symptoms occur. Therapy includes topical treatments such as tar cream plus ultraviolet light or local nitrogen mustard, and systemic treatment with steroids and radiation therapy.

Chemotherapy regimens are used but not with great success. (Wolff, pp. 530-531)
36. (C) Severe cases require systemic steroids, often with the addition of azathioprine. Dapsone is useful in mild cases, and occasionally in very mild cases (or for local recurrences) topical glucocorticoid therapy will suffice.
37. (D) Nodular melanoma is invasive from the start. Women do better than men; trunk lesions and depigmented lesions carry a worse prognosis. Prognosis is directly related to depth of the lesion. (Wolff, pp. 289, 305)
38. (B) It is a persistent dermatitis around the mouth, with acral involvement that begins as vesicles but is soon crusted. Later it goes on to involve the scalp, hands and trunk, and feet. Treatment is zinc replacement in the diet. It has been described after prolonged parenteral alimentation, malabsorption states, intestinal bypass surgery, and chronic alcoholism. There is an inherited form (autosomal recessive) of the syndrome called acrodermatitis enteropathica. The inherited form occurs in infants and is also treated with zinc. (Wolff, p. 454)
39. (E) Erythema nodosum is a hypersensitivity vasculitis associated with many infections, drugs, malignancies, and inflammatory conditions (sarcoidosis). The peak age is 20-30 and it occurs more commonly in females. The lesions are rare in children. It is a nodular erythematous eruption, usually on the extensor aspects of the legs, less commonly on the thighs and forearms. It regresses by bruise-like color changes in 3-6 weeks without scarring. (Wolff, pp. 148-149)40. (E) A macule is a flat, colored lesion not raised above the surface of the surrounding skin. It is less than 1 cm in diameter. A patch differs from a macule only in size, being greater than 1 cm in diameter. (Kasper, p. 283)
41. (C) A KOH preparation is useful when performed on scaling skin lesions, when a fungal etiology is suspected. The scraped scales are placed on a microscope slide, treated with one or two drops of KOH solution, and examined for hyphae, pseudohyphae, or budding yeast. A Tzanck smear is a cytologic technique for the diagnosis of herpes virus infection from vesicles, and diascopy is to assess whether a skin lesion will blanch with pressure. (Kasper, p. 286)
42. (D) Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection of skin caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus.

It is characterized by superficial pustules that rupture, resulting in a honey-colored crust. The bullous variant is more likely staphylococcal in origin. Treatment requires improving hygiene and soaking the crust, as well as oral antibiotics. (Wolff, pp. 588-589)
43. (E) Localized areas of vitiligo can be seen in numerous primary skin disorders. It can also be caused by systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis and tuberculoid leprosy. In the latter disorder, there is associated anesthesia, anhidrosis, and alopecia of the lesions. Biopsy of the palpable border will reveal granulomas. (Wolff, p. 658)
44. (G) Scleroderma is characterized by typical fibrotic and vascular lesions. These lesions may be periungual telangiectasias that are found in lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis. Another form of telangiectasia, mat telangiectasia, is seen only in scleroderma. These lesions are broad macules $2-7 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter. They are found on the face, oral mucosa, and hands. The nail beds of scleroderma patients often reveal loss of capillary loops, with dilatation of the remaining loops when examined under magnification. (Wolff, p. 398)
45. (D) Drug reactions most frequently result in papulosquamous reactions or diffuse erythroderma. Sulfa drugs frequently cause erythroderma. Other drugs commonly implicated include penicillins, gold, allopurinol, captopril, phenytoin, and carbamazepine. Fever, eosinophilia, and interstitial nephritis frequently accompany the erythroderma. (Kasper, pp. 158-160)
46. (K) Hyperlipoproteinemia is frequently associated with xanthomas, yellow-colored cutaneous papules or plaques. Xanthomas associated with hypertriglyceridemia are frequently eruptive; these yellow papules have an erythematous halo and are most frequently found on extensor surfaces of the extremities and buttocks. (Wolff, p. 450)
47. (I) The first exanthem of secondary syphilis is always macular and faint. Later eruptions may be papulosquamous and often involve the palms and soles. Associated findings that help make the diagnosis include annular plaques on the face, nonscarring alopecia, condylomata lata, mucous patches, lymphadenopathy, malaise, fever, headache, and myalgia. (Wolff, p. 917)
48. (J) Obesity is the most common cause of acanthosis nigricans-a velvety, localized hyperpigmentation. Other causes include gastrointestinal malignancy and endocrinopathy such as acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, Stein-Leventhal syndrome, or insulin-resistant diabetes. (Wolff, p. 86)
49. (A) Cancer chemotherapy most frequently involves rapidly proliferating elements of the skin, resulting in stomatitis and alopecia. Bleomycin, hydroxyurea, and 5-fluorouracil can cause dystrophic nail changes. Other skin manifestations of cancer drugs include sterile cellulitis, phlebitis, ulceration of pressure areas, urticaria, angioedema, and exfoliative dermatitis. The underlying malignancy often makes diagnosis of skin disease more difficult. (Wolff, p. 1011)50. (C) Chloroquine is used for certain skin diseases such as lupus and polymorphous light eruption, but can also cause skin reactions and exacerbate porphyria cutanea tarda. Black pigmentation can involve the face, mucous membrane, and pretibial and subungual areas. (Kasper, pp. 302, 322)
51. (D) Birth control pills, sulfonamides, and penicillins are common drugs that can cause erythema nodosum. This is a panniculitis characterized by tender, subcutaneous, erythematous nodules characteristically found on the anterior portion of the legs. (Wolff, pp. 148-149)
52. (B) The only common skin reaction with tetracyclines is photosensitivity. However, the drug
is contraindicated in children under 8 years of age because of the risk of discoloring permanent teeth. (Kasper, p. 802)
53. (D, E) The combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim causes two distinct cutaneous reactions: an urticarial eruption in the first few days of therapy and a morbilliform eruption occurring a week or more after therapy has begun. This latter reaction is particularly common in patients with AIDS. Sulfonamides cause numerous skin lesions, including erythema nodosum. (Wolff, pp. 148-149)# Endocrinology Questions

1. (C) Primary hypothyroidism is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in adults. Primary hypothyroidism is several times more common in women than in men and occurs most often between the ages of 40 and 60 . Postablative hypothyroidism (radiation or surgery induced) is also very common. (Felig, p.316)
2. (B) Diminished concentrating ability and proteinuria occur even when the glomerular filtration rate is near normal. The severity of renal involvement correlates with the duration and magnitude of serum uric acid elevation. Uric acid and monosodium urate deposit in the renal parenchyma. These deposits can cause intrarenal obstruction and elicit an inflammatory response as well. Hypertension, nephrolithiasis, and pyelonephritis can also contribute to the nephropathy of gout. (Kasper, p. 1704)
3. (E) With pituitary hypofunctioning, gonadotropin deficiency is the most common early manifestation in both men and women. Growth hormone secretion is also impaired early on, but is less clinically apparent. (Felig, p. 681)
4. (C) Disease states, due to abnormal intracellular receptors, include androgen insensitivity; cortisol resistance; vitamin D-dependent rickets, type II; thyroid hormone resistance; and pseudohypoaldosteronism. Androgen insensitivity syndrome is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor, and it affects 1 in 100,000 chromosomal males. Because the androgen receptor is X-linked, it only affects males. The phenotypic presentation can vary from complete androgen insensitivity (female external features) to partial insensitivity causing ambiguous or normal male features and infertility. There are several different types of cell membrane receptors. (Kasper, pp. 2217-2218)
5. (D) Beta-carotene increases the patient's tolerance for sunlight, apparently by quenching active intermediates. Beta-carotene is an effective scavenger of free radicals. Although many affected individuals can tolerate sun exposure while taking beta-carotene, it has no effect on the basic metabolic defect in porphyrin-heme synthesis. (Kasper, p. 2308)
6. (E) FSH is said to encourage maturation of a follicle in the human menstrual cycle. The cardinal hormonal change in phase I is a rise in FSH caused by a decrease in the level of estrogens and a waning activity of the corpus luteum. In men, FSH stimulates Sertoli cells, which have an important role in spermatogenesis. (Kasper, p. 2094)
7. (E) In hyperparathyroidism, bony lesions are lytic and can cause pain. The cortical surfaces are thinned and much of the bone is demineralized. The fibrotic bulging lesions within bone are termed brown tumors. Fluid-filled cysts can also occur (osteitis fibrosa cystica). Anemia is common, and the QT interval can be shortened if the calcium is high enough. Hypertension is common. Most patients with hyperparathyroidism have a simple adenoma that functions autonomously, so that hormone is secreted with high calcium. In about 10-15\% of cases, hyperplasia of all the parathyroid glands (chief cell hyperplasia) is the cause. Differentiation from adenoma is important to determine thecorrect surgical approach but is, unfortunately, very difficult. (Kasper, p. 2254)
8. (E) Surgical removal is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism. When the glands, or their blood vessels, have merely been damaged and not removed, tissue often regenerates. Hypoparathyroidism can frequently follow thyroid surgery. The incidence varies and depends on the extent of resection, the skill of the surgeon, and the degree of diligence in diagnosing hypocalcemia. (Kasper, p. 2264)
9. (C) Water diuresis is impaired in adrenocortical insufficiency. Lack of aldosterone also favors the development of hyperkalemia and mild acidosis. The decreased circulating volume, secondary to aldosterone deficiency, is one of the factors resulting in elevated basal antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels and thus hyponatremia. (Kasper, p. 2141)
10. (D) Because DI is usually caused by destruction, or agenesis, of the posterior pituitary, its normal signaling is lost. Pituitary DI can also result from trauma, tumors (both primary and secondary), granulomas, infections, inflammatory diseases, chemical toxins, congenital malformations, and genetic disorders.

Depending on the cause, the MRI may demonstrate other associated findings. (Kasper, p. 3100)
11. (D) Hypertriglyceridemia may result in part from hyperinsulinism, because insulin is one of the factors involved in lipoprotein secretion by the liver. With massive obesity, there is an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disorders, and gallstones. Young men with morbid obesity have a 12 -fold higher mortality risk than the general population. Even in old age (65-74 years), the mortality is doubled in obese men. Cardiovascular disease is the most important factor. (Felig, pp. 954-958)
12. (D) High ferritin, hepatomegaly, skin changes, and diabetes suggest hemochromatosis. The arthritis is characterized by chondrocalcinosis, but, unlike idiopathic chondrocalcinosis, the
hands are usually involved first. The arthropathy often progresses despite phlebotomy. Liver disease is usually the presenting feature. Skin pigmentation is predominantly by melanin. Heart failure is the most common cardiac problem. Addison's does not involve the liver, and Wilson's usually presents at an earlier age and does not cause diabetes. In amyloidosis, skin pigmentation is not a feature. (Kasper, p. 2301)
13. (B) In patients with acute intermittent porphyria, oral phenothiazines may be used for abdominal or muscle pains, and narcotics may also be used, but barbiturates should be avoided. Sulfonamides are unsafe, but penicillin and its derivatives are safe. Other unsafe medications include alcohol, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and synthetic estrogens and progestogens. Most heterozygotes remain asymptomatic unless a precipitating factor such as a drug or weight loss is present. Poorly localized abdominal pain is the most common symptom. (Kasper, pp. 2305-2306)
14. (E) One of the most efficient ways to define obesity is by BMI, which is calculated by weight/height ${ }^{2}$, calculated using kilograms for weight and meters for height. This man's BMI is between 23 and $24 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and confers no special risk. (The acceptable range is 20-25.) (Kasper, p. 422)
15. (E) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a defect in the action of vasopressin on the renal tubules. This can be genetic, and variants include X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive. Numerous drugs can cause the syndrome, as can many forms of renal disease. Hypercalcemia and hypokalemia can also cause the syndrome. (Felig, p. 233)
16. (B) Glycogen storage is not characteristic of TaySachs disease. Ganglioside accumulation can now be diagnosed by decreased hexosaminidase in peripheral leukocytes. Tay-Sachs is characterized as a lysosomal storage disease. Mental retardation, seizures, blindness, and a retinal cherry red spot are characteristic.It is most common in Ashkenazi Jews and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. (Kasper, pp. 2319-2320)
17. (A) In addition to peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy, cardiac involvement, tongue enlargement, gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations, and carpal tunnel syndrome are also seen in amyloidosis. The specific diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with presence of amyloid with specific stains. In primary amyloidosis and myeloma, the amyloid protein is of the AL type. In reactive amyloidosis, the protein is of the amyloid A protein (AA) type. (Kasper, p. 2027)
18. (D) Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by increased levels of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid. The syndrome occurs in relation to malignant tumors that have metastasized, usually with hepatic implants. Gastrointestinal carcinoids are most commonly found in the appendix. These are very slow growing, thus the 5-year survival rate is $99 \%$. Many carcinoids are discovered as incidental findings on autopsy. (Kasper, pp. 2224-2225)
19. (B) Central diabetes insipidus is most commonly caused by a primary deficit in the secretion of vasopressin by the posterior pituitary. It is usually caused by agenesis or destruction of vasopressin-producing neurons by either a developmental, acquired, genetic, or idiopathic disorder. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is the failure of the kidney to respond to ADH. It can be acquired, genetic, or medication related. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
20. (A) In familial hypercholesterolemia, there is an increased incidence of CAD, and hypercholesterolemia occurs along with tuberous xanthomas, arcus senilis, and atheromas. Most affected individuals are heterozygous for the mutant gene. Important secondary causes include DM, obesity/dietary intake, hypothyroidism, renal disease (nephritic syndrome), and cholestatic liver disease. Alcohol usually improves lipid profiles in small amounts and in excess causes increases in triglycerides. Estrogen as well improves lipid profiles. The
other choices are not important in affecting lipid levels. (Kasper, pp. 2288-2294)
21. (E) In Type II diabetes, high levels of insulin and insulin resistance have multiple effects on lipid metabolism. These include increases in triglycerides, low HDL, and normal to high LDL. The high triglycerides respond to insulin therapy and to weight loss, while the low HDL responds to exercise. (Kasper, p. 2294)
22. (B) The diagnosis is inherited Gaucher's disease since it is an autosomal recessive disorder. There is no acquired form of the disease. The glucocerebrosides are derived from lipid catabolites, from the membranes of senescent leukocytes and erythrocytes. Although the juvenile form may have severe neurologic symptoms (mental retardation, spasticity, ataxia), the adult form usually has no neurologic symptoms. Like Tay-Sachs, it is a lysosomal storage disease with a predilection for Ashkenazi Jews. (Kasper, p. 2318)
23. (C) There are many types of glycogen storage diseases, each caused by a different enzymatic abnormality. The best known types of glycogen storage disease are those that have hepatichypoglycemic pathophysiology (e.g., von Gierke's disease) or those that have muscle energy pathophysiology (McArdle's disease). In McArdle's symptoms usually develop in adulthood, and it is marked by cramps and muscle injury with strenuous exercise, but not with usual activities. Gaucher's and Tay-Sachs disease are lysosomal storage diseases. (Kasper, p. 2322)
24. (C) Cystinuria is commonly associated with hexagonal crystals in the urine. Cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine are excreted in great excess by patients homozygous for the disease. The tissues manifesting the transport defect of cystinuria are the proximal renal tubule and the jejunal mucosa. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Cystine kidney stones ( $1 \%$ of all renal stones) are the major clinical manifestation, and they are radiopaque. (Kasper, p. 1714)25. (A) Magnesium deficiency is most commonly due to alcoholism. Renal loss and malabsorption are also common causes. Magnesium deficiency is not seen in hypervitaminosis E. Causes of magnesium deficiency also include milk diets in infants, the diuretic phase of acute tubular necrosis, chronic diuretic therapy, acute pancreatitis, and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. The symptoms of hypomagnesemia include anorexia, nausea, tremor, and mood alteration. Symptoms can also be caused by the associated hypocalcemia or hypokalemia. (Kasper, pp. 2244-2245)
26. (D) Symptoms of vitamin A intoxication occur in infants or adults ingesting over 50,000 IU of vitamin A daily. The prognosis is good when vitamin A intake ceases. Rare occurrences of hypercalcemia with vitamin A intoxication have been reported. (Kasper, pp. 407-408)
27. (D) The deformity of the hands is due to short metacarpals. Other deformities include short metatarsals, round facies, and thickening of the calvarium. The syndrome is caused by target organ unresponsiveness to PTH, and was the first hormone resistance syndrome described. (Felig, pp. 1143-1145)
28. (C) The findings of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are the same as in hypoparathyroidism, but the serum PTH levels are appropriately increased. The normal urinary rise in cAMP does not occur when these patients are injected with exogenous (normal) PTH. (Felig, pp. 1143-1145)
29. (A) Familial combined hyperlipidemia has an incidence of $1 / 100$. It is an autosomal dominant disorder and different affected family members may display different dyslipidemic phenotypes. Familial hypercholesterolemia ( $1 / 500$ ) and familial defective Apo B ( $1 / 1000$ ) are also common. The other two disorders (Apo C-II deficiency and lipoprotein lipase deficiency) are extremely rare. (Felig, p. 1010)
30. (B) This lesion is more frequent in females and may antedate other clinical signs and symptoms of diabetes. The plaques are round, firm,
and reddish-brown to yellow in color. They most commonly involve the legs but can also involve the hands, arms, abdomen, and head. (Kasper, p. 2169)
31. (A) Allopurinol inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, resulting in decreased uric acid production. Allopurinol is particularly useful in the treatment of uric acid nephrolithiasis in gouty individuals. Even if the gouty individual has calcium oxalate stones, allopurinol may be helpful. (Kasper, p. 2047)
32. (B) Hyperphosphatemia rarely causes any symptoms directly. Its secondary effects on calcium can result in hypocalcemic tetany or metastatic calcification. The usual cause of hyperphosphatemia is uremia. (Felig, pp. 1156-1157)
33. (B) The severe form of Marfan syndrome is caused by a mutation in a single allele of the fibrillin gene (FBN1). The gene product is a major component of elastin-associated microfibrils. Long, thin extremities; ectopia lentis; and aortic aneurysms are the classical triad. Milder forms of the disease probably also occur but are hard to classify. Mutations in the FBN2 gene can also cause Marfan syndrome, but without aneurysms. (Kasper, pp. 2329-2330)
34. (A) Nephrogenic DI can be caused by drugs such as lithium, metabolic factors, vascular disease, ureteral obstruction, and genetic factors. (Kasper, p. 2099)
35. (B) In the familial type 1 form, the defect is believed to be a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase activity. It is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome, and usually presents in childhood with typical eruptive xanthoma and abdominal pain secondary to acute pancreatitis. Secondary hyperchylomicronemia (diabetes, hypothyroidism, uremia) is a much more common syndrome. (Felig, p. 1027)
36. (C) Subcutaneous xanthomas begin to appear at about age 20 and may involve Achillis tendons, elbows, and tibial tuberosities. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be monogenic orpolygenic in its inheritance. The disorder is common, and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is felt to affect 1 in 500 individuals. It can be secondary to other diseases such as hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, or even porphyria. Xanthelasmas after the age of 50 are often not related to any dyslipidemia at all. (Felig, p. 1016)
37. (A) In the rare familial form, raised yellow plaques appear on palms and fingers, and reddish-yellow xanthomas occur on the elbows. This disorder is felt to be secondary to accumulation of abnormal chylomicron and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants. It is probably due to inherited homozygous defects in Apo E-II structure. (Felig, pp. 1024-1025)
38. (E) Triglycerides are over 150 and are raised by alcohol intake, estrogens, stress, insulin, and physical activity. Cholesterol levels are average or mildly elevated. HDL is usually low. Dietary therapy and the maintenance of ideal weight is the cornerstone of therapy. (Felig, pp. 1029-1030)
39. (B) Hypertriglyceridemia is usually secondary to DM or drugs, rather than a genetic disorder. It can be a normal response to caloric excess or alcohol ingestion and is common in the third trimester of pregnancy. (Felig, p. 1027)
40. (C) In DM, there is an obligatory osmotic diuresis, but in DI there is lack of water resorption in the tubules. Both result in polyuria, but in DM, there will be substantial glucosuria as well. The large amount of urine output (usually $>50 \mathrm{~mL} /$ $\mathrm{kg} /$ day) is characteristic of polyuric states, such as DI, not a bladder problem. Psychogenic polydipsia is commonly seen in patients with psychiatric problems on medications. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
41. (D) In Western societies, most dyslipidemias are secondary. The most common predisposing cause is diet, and the second common is DM. Hypothyroidism, renal disease, alcoholism, and anorexia nervosa are also associated with secondary dyslipidemias. Many drugs (e.g.,
estrogen, glucocorticoids) can also cause secondary dyslipidemias. (Felig, pp. 1009-1015)
42. (D) The most important factors in diet-induced cholesterol elevation are the amount of total fat and saturated fat consumed. Cholesterol intake is next in importance. Obesity and caloric excess usually result in high triglyceride levels. (Felig, p. 1010)
43. (D) The elevated ALP and hydroxyproline are diagnostic for Paget's disease. The bony lesions are blastic and the sacrum and pelvis are most frequently involved, followed closely by the tibia and femur. Hypercalcemia can complicate immobilization. The etiology is unknown, but a viral agent has been postulated. Symptoms may be absent or severe (pain, deformity). In metastatic cancers of most types the lesion are lytic, and the other metabolic abnormalities do not have an elevation in hydroxyproline. (Kasper, pp. 2279-2281)
44. (A) Many affected persons with vitamin D deficiency have no demonstrable abnormality except for hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and increased PTH levels. Decreased calcium absorption, which is vitamin D dependent, results in mild hypocalcemia that leads to the secondary hyperparathyroidism. This in turn results in increased renal phosphate excretion and hypophosphatemia. (Kasper, p. 2248)
45. (B) Atrial fibrillation and cardiomegaly are common cardiac manifestations, but are more common in the elderly. Other symptoms include palpitations, tachycardia, nervousness, sweating, and dyspnea. Sinus tachycardia is the most common cardiac manifestation in a young individual with hyperthyroidism. (Kasper, p. 2113)
46. (B) Needle biopsy can be used in numerous diseases, but the main rationale is to differentiate benign from malignant nodules. A thyroid scan is appropriate if the TSH is suppressed suggesting a possible "hot" nodule (hyperfunctioning nodules are very rarely malignant). The specimen must be read by an experienced cytologist. It is difficult to diagnose differentiated follicular carcinoma or to differentiate lymphoma fromHashimoto's thyroiditis. Papillary carcinoma is the easiest diagnosis to make by needle biopsy. (Kasper, pp. 2126-2127)
47. (E) Regulation of vasopressin is by osmotic and nonosmotic stimuli such as volume and neural stimuli arising outside the hypothalamus. As little as $15 \%$ of cells remaining in the posterior hypothalamus are sufficient to prevent permanent DI. (Kasper, p. 2097)
48. (D) Classification of hypoglycemia includes spontaneous causes such as reactive or fasting hypoglycemia and pharmacologic or toxic causes. The diagnosis of insulinoma is most certain when Whipple's triad is fulfilled: symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, low plasma glucose, and relief of symptoms with elevation of plasma glucose to normal. (Kasper, p. 2227)
49. (A) Cardiac failure and arrhythmias frequently occur in cardiac amyloid. The ECG reveals lowvoltage QRS complexes and conduction disturbances. Red cells are not involved, and involvement of the thyroid, liver, and pancreas is usually asymptomatic. The precursors of the AL, amyloid protein found in primary AL and myeloma, are kappa and lambda light chains. Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) is the precursor for the AA amyloid found in secondary AL. (Kasper, pp. 2024-2029)
50. (A) This person has either fasting or reactive hypoglycemia. Glucagon exerts a marked effect on carbohydrate, fat, and lipid metabolism, and increases cAMP in many tissues. It is the first counterregulatory hormone to respond to hypoglycemia, and it does this by increasing glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glucagonomas of the pancreas present with features such as mild DM, psychiatric disturbances, diarrhea, venous thromboses, and skin findings (necrolytic migratory erythema). (Kasper, p. 2180)
51. (E) In mild cases, dietary therapy may suffice, but the vast majority of patients require drug therapy. Statins are clearly the most effective medications available, but the majority of patients will not have optimal cholesterol control, even with maximum doses of a statin.

Homozygous patients always require combination therapy. (Felig, pp. 1019-1021)
52. (C) Primary hyperparathyroidism develops in over $87 \%$ of those with MEN I. Polyendocrine adenomatosis, type I, frequently includes islet cell tumors of the pancreas, leading to the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, insulinomas, and glucagonomas. Inheritance is via an autosomal dominant pattern. Hypercalcemia does not usually occur until after the first decade. (Felig, p. 1356)
53. (E) HRT can reduce osteoporosis related fractures. Estrogens cause thickening of vaginal mucosa and can improve urogenital symptoms, and postmenopausal symptoms. The evidence for protection against CAD and dementia is epidemiologic. Randomized trials have failed to show a reduction in CAD risk with HRT. The risk of venothromboembolism and breast cancer is increased not decreased. (Kasper, pp. 2210-2212)
54. (C) This patient has Cushing's syndrome. The diagnosis is established by demonstrating increased cortisol secretion (24-hour urine cortisol collection) or by failure to suppress AM cortisol levels after overnight dexamethasone administration. Investigations for either adrenal tumor or pituitary adenoma (with CT or MR ) are only considered once the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is established. (Kasper, pp. 2134-2135)
55. (A) Growth hormone excess in acromegaly produces hypertrophy of muscle. Initially, strength may be increased, but this is transient, and a third of patients will experience weakness, likely secondary to myopathy. (Kasper, p. 2090)
56. (C) Vitamin D-resistant rickets is a familial disorder, with an X-linked recessive pattern, treated with pharmacologic doses of vitamin D. Half the affected individuals have alopecia, and this tends to correlate with severity.

Rickets and osteomalacia are characterized by impaired mineralization of bone. Osteoporosis is a disorder with a diminished amount of normally mineralized bone. (Felig, p. 1186)57. (B) Risk of death in anorexia nervosa is also associated with hypothermia, suicide, or pneumonia with emaciation. Because of the danger of ventricular tachyarrhythmias, patients should be followed with ECGs. A prolonged QT interval is a sign of danger. In addition, severe weight loss can lead to both systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the ventricles. (Kasper, pp. 430-431)
58. (E) In gouty patients, nephrolithiasis and uric acid nephropathy may occur. The association of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pyelonephritis, and hyperlipoproteinemia with gout contributes to the high prevalence of renal disease in these individuals. (Kasper, p. 2046)
59. (C) Vitamin D levels are decreased in osteomalacia. In severe osteomalacia, there is bowing of the long bones, inward deformity of the long bones, and wide osteoid borders on bone surfaces. Hypocalcemia is characteristic of osteomalacia; however, secondary hyperparathyroidism often raises the serum calcium to low normal levels. The PTH-mediated increase in phosphate clearance often produces hypophosphatemia. (Kasper, p. 2248)
60. (B) Hepatorenal syndrome frequently complicates hepatic failure. Although it can develop gradually, acute renal failure can also be precipitated by hemodynamic stresses (bleeding, diuresis). The earliest manifestations are intrarenal vasoconstriction and avid sodium retention. (Kasper, p. 1867)
61. (D) In phenylketonuria, a low phenylalanine diet with relentless attention to details of diet is required for a good outcome. The diet should be started by 3 weeks of age. Children of mothers with phenylketonuria can be affected if exposed to phenylalanine in utero. Therefore, women with the disorder should stay on a restricted diet until they complete childbearing. In phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid and dietary supplements must be provided. (Kasper, p. 2333)
62. (B) Wilson's disease includes cirrhosis of the liver, signs of basal ganglia disease, and a brownish pigmented ring at the corneal margin (Kayser-Fleischer ring). Ceruloplasmin levels are low. The gene for Wilson's disease is located on the long arm of chromosome 13. In some cases, it is possible to identify carrier states and make prenatal diagnoses. The relationship between the abnormal gene and the metabolic defect (inability to regulate copper balance) is unclear. (Kasper, p. 2314)
63. (C) The gold standard is still a fasting plasma glucose $=7 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(126 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ on two separate occasions. GTTs are rarely required. With typical symptoms even an elevated random sugar is diagnostic. (Felig, p. 857)
64. (A) Other stimulators of protein kinases include platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor. Tyrosine phosphorylation results from this interaction. Insulin-resistant states can be caused by prereceptor resistance (mutated insulin, anti-insulin antibodies) or receptor and postreceptor resistance. (Kasper, p. 2155)
65. (C) The action of insulin involves all three major metabolic fuels (carbohydrate, protein, fat). It is active in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. In each there are anticatabolic as well as anabolic effects. These tend to reinforce each other. (Felig, p. 835)
66. (D) Infection or other acute medical condition is the usual precipitant for thyroid storm. Radioactive iodine treatment or abrupt withdrawal of antithyroid medications is also implicated. The key diagnostic features are fever, tachycardia, and central nervous system dysfunction. (Felig, pp. 309-310)
67. (B) All the causes listed may delay puberty, but the most common cause by far is normal variation in growth pattern. There is often a family history of delayed puberty in parents or siblings. In these individuals, bone age oftencorrelates better with the onset and progression of puberty than does chronologic age. (Felig, p. 678)
68. (D) Approximately, one-third of unselected women with metastatic breast cancer will respond to tamoxifen. Presence of estrogen receptors (ER) or PR improves the likelihood of response. If the tumor is both ER and PR positive, the response rate is $70 \%$. (Felig, p. 1441)
69. (B) A generally increased risk of breast cancer is associated with nulliparity, late first pregnancy, and, especially, a history of maternal breast cancer. Prior history of breast cancer is of course a powerful risk factor. (Felig, p. 1439)
70. (D) Although the variation is great depending on occupation, hobbies, and so forth, generally only one-third of energy is utilized for physical activity. Height is not used at all in calculating RMR, and RMR is higher in men than in women of identical weight. Amino acids ingested without other energy sources are inefficiently incorporated into protein. Current recommendations are to encourage full adult levels of protein, vitamins, and minerals in the elderly. (Kasper, pp. 399-403)
71. (C) The diagnosis is secondary hyperparathyroidism as a consequence of the chronic renal disease. Calcium deposits are seen in the periarticular areas of the fourth and fifth metacarpophalangeal, third proximal interphalangeal, and fourth distal interphalangeal joints. There is slight soft tissue swelling, especially, of the fourth and fifth metacarpophalangeal joints. Calcification in scleroderma is subcutaneous in location. In gout, if monosodium urate is deposited it could appear as a soft tissue mass. (Kasper, p. 1656)
72. (B) Autonomous adrenal tumors are adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitive and fail to demonstrate a brisk rise in urinary 17-hydroxycorticoids. Androgenic effects, such as hirsutism, are usually absent. In Cushing's syndrome, secondary to an autonomous adrenal tumor, onset is usually gradual, and hirsutism,
other androgenic effects, and hyperpigmentation are absent. (Felig, pp. 2135-2136)
73. (A) DM is a syndrome consisting of hyperglycemia, large vessel disease, microvascular disease, and neuropathy. The classic presenting symptoms are increased thirst, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss. In Type II diabetes, the presentation can be more subtle and is often made when the patient is asymptomatic. (Felig, p. 856)
74. (I) Pyoderma gangrenosum is not a cutaneous manifestation of diabetes. Perineal pruritus in a diabetic is almost always associated with Candida albicans. A severe external otitis can occur in older patients. It is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is characterized by ear pain, drainage, fever, and leukocytosis. Facial nerve paralysis can occur and is a poor prognostic sign. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a plaque-like lesion with a brown border and yellow center usually found on the anterior leg surface. (Kasper, p. 2169)
75. (A, C, E) Background retinopathy is present in about $90 \%$ of diabetes after 25-30 years of disease. Microaneurysms, dilated veins, dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and hard exudates are common findings. (Kasper, p. 2163)
76. (B, D) Proliferative retinopathy carries a high risk of vitreous hemorrhage, scarring, retinal detachment, and blindness. Proliferative retinopathy is associated with nephropathy and CAD, and is associated with a poor prognosis, for life as well as for vision. (Kasper, pp. 2163-2164)
77. (B) High prolactin level suppresses luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH), and can result in low plasma gonadotropin and testosterone levels. It may not be obvious on physical examination. Therapy with a dopamine agonist may lower prolactin levels and reverse impotence. (Kasper, pp. 271-274)
78. (D) An absent orgasm, when libido and erectile function are normal, invariably indicates that organic disease is absent. Loss of desire canalso be caused by psychologic disturbance, but may indicate androgen deficiency or drug effect. (Kasper, pp. 271-274)
79. (E) Failure of detumescence-priapism-can be caused by sickle cell anemia or chronic granulocytic leukemia. Priapism must be treated promptly to preserve future erectile functioning. (Kasper, p. 272)
80. (B) Vascular disease, by itself or in conjunction with peripheral neuropathy in DM, is a common cause of erectile dysfunction. The lesions can be in large vessels (aortic occlusion, Leriche syndrome), small arteries, or even in the sinusoidal spaces. (Kasper, pp. 271-274)
81. (E) Idiopathic hirsutism may simply represent an extreme of normal androgen production. It is diagnosed by demonstrating minimal elevation of androgens and exclusion of other causes. Management is primarily by cosmetic therapy, although drugs to suppress androgen production and/or androgen effects on the hair follicle can be used. (Kasper, pp. 275-278)
82. (C) The most severe form of PCOD, SteinLeventhal syndrome, is associated with chronic anovulation, hirsutism, enlarged cystic ovaries, obesity, and amenorrhea. The spectrum of disease, however, is quite wide, and some patients have only mild hirsutism. (Kasper, pp. 275-277)
83. (F) Krukenberg's tumors of the ovary stimulate surrounding ovarian stromal tissue to produce excess androgen. When onset of hair growth (with or without frank virilization) is very rapid, a neoplastic source of androgen is suggested. As well as ovarian tumors, the potential neoplasms include adenomas and carcinomas of the adrenal gland. (Kasper, pp. 275-278)
84. (D) Attenuated forms of adrenal hyperplasia can present with hirsutism at puberty or in adulthood. Elevated levels of a precursor of cortisol biosynthesis such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, or 11deoxycortisol can present. ACTH infusion will increase the precursor level, and dexamethasone will suppress it. (Kasper, pp. 275-278)
85. (A) Salivary gland enlargement occurs both in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia (BN). Other common findings in AN include constipation, bradycardia, hypotension, hypercarotinemia, and soft downy hair growth (lanugo). Menses are usually absent. (Kasper, p. 430)
86. (D) Hyperglycemia is not seen in eating disorders, and would suggest an alternate diagnosis for the weight loss such as diabetes. Hypoglycemia and low estrogens and gonadotropins are frequently seen in anorexia nervosa (AN). BUN and creatinine may be elevated. Hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and alkalosis are frequently seen in BN. (Kasper, p. 430)
87. (E) Low QRS voltages, sinus bradycardia, and ST-T changes are common. However, the presence of a prolonged QT interval is most suggestive of serious cardiac arrhythmias. (Kasper, p. 431)
88. (B) Hospitalization should be considered when the body weight dips below $75 \%$ of the expected. The goal is to achieve a weight of $90 \%$ of that expected. Vomiting is more characteristic of bulimia than anorexia nervosa (AN). (Kasper, p. 432)
89. (B) Recurrent vomiting and exposure of the teeth to stomach acid leads to loss of dental enamel and eventual chipping and erosion of the teeth. The vomiting may be manually induced, but eventually most patients with bulimia (BN) are able to trigger vomiting at will. (Kasper, p. 433)
90. (C) The patient is most likely to develop glomerulosclerosis. This can be diffuse or nodular (Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules). Poor metabolic control is probably a major factor in the progression of diabetic nephropathy. (Felig, pp. 900-901)
91. (B) AN has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric illness at $5 \%$ per decade. The mortality for BN is very low, and $50 \%$ have a full recovery within 10 years. Only $25 \%$ have persistent symptoms of BN over many years,and the disease does not usually progress to AN. (Kasper, pp. 431-433)
92. (I) Low fiber diets are frequently prescribed during flares of inflammatory bowel disease to reduce diarrhea and pain. There is no level 1 evidence to support this practice. Similar diets are often prescribed for diverticulitis or other conditions associated with a narrowed or stenosed colon. It may be prescribed for patients with a new ostomy. When acute symptoms subside, however, restrictions concerning dietary fiber should be stopped. (Kasper, p. 1786)
93. (A) Restricting caloric intake and weight reduction are important components of the medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes. Most patients should be referred to a dietician to help construct a diet appropriate in caloric intake. (Kasper, p. 2171)
94. (C) Some patients with hypertension are salt sensitive, and will lower their blood pressure with salt restriction. Low sodium diets are also recommended in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), ascites, or chronic renal failure. (Kasper, p. 1472)
95. (F) After gastrectomy, avoiding simple sugars and limiting liquids can ameliorate symptoms of dumping. Early dumping occurs within 30 minutes of eating and is characterized by vasomotor symptoms such as palpitations, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and diaphoresis. Late dumping includes similar symptoms plus dizziness, confusion, and even syncope. It occurs 1.2-3 hours after eating. (Kasper, p. 1757)
96. (H) The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are improved with protein restriction and a bowel elimination routine with lactulose. It is presumed that this results in lower levels of serum ammonia, but other substances in the serum may be implicated. These include mercaptans, short-chain fatty acids, and phenol. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the brain are also increased. Chronic encephalopathy can be controlled with restricting protein intake and taking lactulose (osmotic laxative).

Restricting daytime protein intake in patients with Parkinson's disease may improve the efficacy of levodopa therapy. (Kasper, p. 1868)
97. (E) Chocolate, ethanol, caffeine, and tobacco decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Other effective treatments for GERD include low fat diet, weight loss, avoiding bedtime snacks, and elevating the head of the bed while sleeping. (Kasper, pp. 1742-1743)
98. (D) Scurvy is characterized by a tendency to hemorrhage and perifollicular hyperkeratotic papules in which hairs become fragmented and buried. Gums are involved only if teeth are present. It can occur in infants 6-12 months of age who are on processed milk formulas, without citrus fruit or vegetable supplementation. The peak incidence in the United States is in poor and elderly people and alcoholics. It is frequently associated with other nutritional deficiencies (e.g., folic acid). (Kasper, pp. 406-407)
99. (E) Excessive vitamin A ingestion can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and papilledema. Deficiency of vitamin A can cause night blindness and progress to visual loss. It is common in children in developing countries and is a major cause of blindness. (Kasper, p. 408)
100. (A) Pharmacologic doses of niacin for hypercholesterolemia may cause histamine release, which results in flushing, pruritus, and GI disturbance. Asthma may be aggravated, acanthosis nigricans can occur, and in high doses, elevation of uric acid and fasting blood sugar can occur. Hepatic toxicity, including cholestatic jaundice, has been described with large doses. (Kasper, p. 405)
101. (B) Thiamine deficiency can cause high-output cardiac failure (wet beriberi) or neurologic symptoms (dry beriberi). In North America, thiamine deficiency occurs in alcoholics or those with chronic disease. In alcoholics, deficiency is secondary to low intake, impaired absorption and storage, and accelerated destruction. Genetic factors are important as clinical manifestationsoccur only in a small proportion of chronically malnourished individuals. Beriberi heart disease is characterized by peripheral vasodilatation, sodium and water retention, and high-output CHF. (Kasper, p. 403)
102. (A) Diarrhea, dementia, and dermatitis are the classic triad for pellagra (niacin deficiency).

The diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion and response to therapy, and can be confirmed by demonstrating low levels of the urinary metabolites 2-methylnicotinamide and 2pyridone. Small doses of niacin ( $10 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) with adequate dietary tryptophan will cure pellagra secondary to nutritional deficiency. (Kasper, p. 405)# Gastroenterology Questions

72. A 67-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of respiratory failure from pneumonia. He requires artificial ventilation and inotropic support. On the third day in the ICU, he develops melena and a drop in his hemoglobin. Urgent upper endoscopy is performed and it reveals three gastric ulcers in the fundus and body of the stomach. Appropriate treatment is started. (SELECT ONE)
73. A 70-year-old man has a long history of heartburn and dyspepsia. He has tried many medications but the symptoms always return. His upper endoscopy is normal with no ulcers. Routine biopsies of the gastric mucosa report "gastritis." (SELECT ONE)
74. A 57-year-old woman experiences frequent symptoms of heartburn. She reports no weight loss, diarrhea, or dysphagia symptoms. Past medical history is significant for $B_{12}$ deficiency treated with monthly injections. She appears well, and the examination is normal, except for some patches on her arms where she has lost all the skin pigmentation. Her upper endoscopy is normal, except for gastric biopsies commenting on gastritis. (SELECT ONE)
75. A 54-year-old man is investigated for weight loss, epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. He appears ill; on examination, there is epigastric tenderness and marked peripheral edema. Upper endoscopy reveals large mucosal folds in the body and fundus of the stomach. Biopsies are consistent with a diagnosis of Ménétrier's disease. (SELECT ONE)
76. A 65-year-old man has developed abdominal pain, early satiety, nausea, and vomiting. He reports no weight loss or change in bowel habits. He had a partial gastrectomy 30 years ago for a bleeding gastric ulcer. Upper endoscopy finds erythema of the gastric remnant, and biopsies report epithelial injury and minimal inflammation (gastritis). (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (F) Carcinoid tumors account for up to $75 \%$ of all GI endocrine tumors. They are frequently multiple. Primary carcinoid tumors of the appendix are common but rarely metastasize. Those in the large colon may metastasize but do not function. Carcinoids are the most common GI endocrine tumors. They arise from neuroendocrine cells most commonly in the GI tract, pancreas, or bronchi. GI carcinoids cause abdominal pain, bleeding, or even obstruction (usually via intussusception). Carcinoid syndrome is characterized by flushing, diarrhea, and valvular heart disease. (Kasper, p. 532)
2. (D) Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel accounts for about $50 \%$ of malignant tumors of the small bowel. They are most commonly found in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum. Hemorrhage, or obstruction, is the most common presenting symptom. X-ray findings can mimic chronic duodenal ulcer disease or Crohn's disease. (Kasper, p. 532)
3. (E) There is one unique form of lymphoma called IPSID or Mediterranean lymphoma. It diffusely involves the small intestine and usually presents with diarrhea and steatorrhea. Oral antibiotics, early in the disease, provide some benefit, suggesting a possible infectious component to the disorder. Antibiotics and chemotherapy are frequently combined. (Kasper, p. 532)
4. (F) Appendiceal tumors make up nearly half of all carcinoid tumors and are a frequent finding in routine appendectomy specimens. They are usually small, solitary, and benign. Even if they invade locally, they rarely metastasize. (Kasper, p. 532)
5. (E) Primary small bowel lymphoma is more common in the settings of celiac disease, regional enteritis, congenital immune disorders, prior organ transplantation, autoimmune disorders, and AIDS. (Kasper, p. 532)
6. (C, F) Lipomas and carcinoid tumors are most frequently found in the distal ileum. Adenocarcinomas are characteristically more proximal. The ileum has more lymphatic tissue, than the rest of the small bowel, so lymphoma is more common here than in the jejunum or duodenum. However, there is not as strong a predilection for the distal ileum as there is for lipomas and carcinoids. (Kasper, p. 532)
7. (A, E) Acquired lactase deficiency is very common in GI diseases with evidence of mucosal damage. Examples include celiac and tropical sprue, viral and bacterial infections, giardiasis, cystic fibrosis, ulcerative colitis, and regional enteritis. It is not caused by a hypersensitivity reaction. (Kasper, p. 228)
8. (A, C, K, L) This syndrome is likely celiac sprue, but a clinical and histologic improvement with a gluten-free diet would be required for confirmation. The decrease in pancreatic enzyme production is secondary to decreased intestinal secretion of hormones that stimulate the pancreas. Dermatitis herpetiformis might be related to celiac disease. Although gross malabsorption is the classical description of celiac sprue, it can present with isolated deficiencies such as iron deficiency anemia. (Kasper, pp. 1770-1773)9. (F, J) Whipple's disease is caused by infection with a Gram-positive bacillus called Tropheryma whippelii. The disease, previously invariably fatal, can be controlled with long-term antibiotic therapy (at least 1 year), and some patients seem to be cured. Arthritis and central nervous system (CNS) involvement are other manifestations of this rare disease. (Kasper, pp. 1774-1775)
10. (B) Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a nonbeta islet cell tumor of the pancreas. It may be associated with the syndrome of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (MEN I). The syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple ulcers, ulcers resistant to therapy, ulcers in unusual locations, strong family history of ulcers, unexplained diarrhea, or evidence of MEN I. (Kasper, p. 1758)
11. (D) Diverticula are present in over $50 \%$ of octogenarians. Most patients remain asymptomatic. They are most common in the sigmoid colon and decrease in frequency in the proximal colon. The relative scarcity of diverticula in underdeveloped nations has led to the hypothesis that low fiber diets result in decreased fecal bulk, narrowing of the colon, and an increased intraluminal pressure to move the small fecal mass. This results in thickening of the muscular coat, and eventually herniations or diverticula of the mucosa at the points where nutrient arteries penetrate the muscularis. (Kasper, p. 1798)
12. (C) Amylase accumulates in the setting of renal failure and thus becomes a less-valuable diagnostic test. Numerous other conditions involving the pancreas, the gut, and the salivary glands can raise amylase levels. Sulfonamides cause pancreatitis; therefore, an elevated amylase is not confusing, but rather a useful test for pancreatitis in patients taking the drug. Morphine can elevate amylase levels in the absence of pancreatitis. (Kasper, p. 1893, 1897)
13. (D) This presentation is typical of esophageal cancer. Lesions in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus are squamous, but in the distal
esophagus, most are adenocarcinomas. The adenocarcinomas develop more commonly from columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus (Barrett's esophagus). Adenocarcinomas of the esophagus have the biologic behavior of gastric cancers. The incidence of squamous cell cancer of the esophagus is decreasing while adenocarcinoma is increasing. Currently, over $50 \%$ of esophageal cancer is adenocarcinoma. The 5-year survival for esophageal cancer is $<5 \%$. Combination therapy seems to be more effective than surgery alone. (Kasper, pp. 523-524)
14. (D) Fat malabsorption demonstrated on stool collection for 72 hours is the gold standard, but does not indicate the exact cause. The Schilling test is useful in testing for vitamin $B_{12}$ absorption. X-rays can be helpful in diagnosing underlying disorders, but are nonspecific. Small intestinal biopsy is useful in determining the cause of malabsorption. (Kasper, p. 1768)
15. (A) The antibody can be demonstrated in $80-90 \%$ of patients, usually late in convalescence, and indicates relative or absolute immunity. In contrast, HBsAg occurs very early and disappears in $<6$ months. Persistence of HBsAg indicates chronic infection. The pattern in this patient is also seen postvaccination, and perhaps as a consequence of remote infection. (Kasper, p. 1834)
16. (D) Gilbert's syndrome may be associated with impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin. It is caused by hereditary decrease in the activity of glucoronosyltransferase in the uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family. More severe enzyme deficits are the cause of the two variants of Crigler-Najjar syndrome. (Kasper, pp. 1819-1820)
17. (A) Intestinal polyposis is a possible indication of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome associated with dark brown spots on the lips and palate. There is characteristic distribution of pigment around lips, nose, eyes, and hands. Tumors of the ovary, breast, pancreas, and endometrium are associated with this syndrome. (Kasper, pp. 198, 553)18. (B) Despite some decline, distal tumors are still the most common. The fact that up to $60 \%$ of tumors are located in the rectosigmoid is the rationale for screening via flexible, fiberoptic sigmoidoscopes. Occult blood testing and colonoscopy are other possible screening techniques. (Kasper, p. 529)
19. (E) This pattern of symptoms is characteristic of afferent loop syndrome. It is caused by distention and incomplete drainage of the afferent loop and requires surgical correction. Bacterial overgrowth of the afferent loop is more common. Its clinical presentation includes postprandial abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea. Fat and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ malabsorption can occur. (Kasper, p. 1757)
20. (B) Pancreatitis in AIDS patients can be caused by cytomegalovirus and cryptosporidium as well as M. avium complex. Drugs are another cause of AIDS-related pancreatitis. (Kasper, p. 1899)
21. (B) Hepatoma is the most likely diagnosis in this man. In China, it is estimated that the lifetime risk of hepatoma in people with chronic hepatitis B is close to $40 \%$. AFP elevations, over $500-1000 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ in the absence of a colonic tumor (or pregnancy), suggest hepatoma. Paraneoplastic syndromes are not common but include erythrocytosis, hypercalcemia, and acquired porphyria. (Kasper, p. 534)
22. (D) Ascitic fluid in uncomplicated cirrhosis of the liver shows a specific gravity $<1.016$. Protein is $<25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$, and the gross appearance is straw-colored. In spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the fluid may be cloudy and the number of white cells (neutrophils) increased. In uncomplicated ascites, the difference between plasma albumin and ascitic fluid albumin is $>1.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. (Kasper, pp. 244-245)
23. (D) Common duct stones can be painless, or may give rise to severe pain, chills, and fever. The jaundice is generally conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Partial obstruction of the common duct produces variable amounts of jaundice and is influenced by the presence of concurrent hepatocellular disease or cholangitis. Although
most such stones originate in the gallbladder, hemolytic disorders and parasitic infections can result in primary bile duct stones. (Kasper, p. 1888)
24. (E) The syndrome is characteristic of carcinoid of midgut origin. The cardiac lesions are more common on the right side (hence murmur accentuation on deep inspiration). Foregut carcinoids (bronchus, stomach, duodenum) frequently are associated with wheezing. The most important mediator of the carcinoid syndrome is serotonin. Serotonin is rapidly metabolized to 5-HIAA, which is rapidly cleared by the kidneys. The measurement of 5-HIAA in the urine is thus the most useful diagnostic test. Its specificity is enhanced by an appropriate diet before testing. (Kasper, p. 2225)
25. (D) These findings are characteristic of achalasia. Anticholinergic medications and dietary changes do not provide much help. Successful therapies include nitroglycerine, nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker), botulinum toxin injected endoscopically, balloon dilatation, and esophageal myotomy (not excision). (Kasper, pp. 1741-1742)
26. (B) These findings are characteristic of scleroderma. If the disease is limited, the prognosis is not necessarily poor. The limited form is characterized by calcinosis, Raynaud's (often with distal ulceration), esophageal motility disorder, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. It has a female preponderance. Renal disease can be severe, but is not the most common cause of death. Esophageal symptoms should be treated aggressively. (Kasper, pp. 1984-1985)
27. (B) The clinical description suggests Ménétrier's disease; however, biopsy is essential to rule out lymphoma or carcinoma. The edema is usually secondary to protein-losing enteropathy. Treatment consists of a high protein diet, anticholinergic therapy, and H2-blockers. In some cases, gastrectomy is required. (Kasper, p. 1762)
28. (E) The carcinoma has occurred in a patient with ulcerative colitis. The barium enema shows a long, constricting lesion in the transverse colon, with the whole colon devoid ofhaustral markings. Some pressure effects are seen in the ileum due to metastases. The diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is made from the clinical symptoms and proctosigmoidoscopic examination of an abnormally inflamed colonic mucosa. (Kasper, p. 1788)
29. (A) In esophageal varices, the esophageal folds are thick and tortuous, giving rise to a wormy or worm-eaten appearance. The radiographic picture would vary with the severity of the varices, as well as the distention of the esophagus. When varices are severe, they should be appreciated in any projection. The left anterior oblique projection is most ideal for its demonstration. (Kasper, pp. 1863-1864)
30. (B) The common causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol, gallstones, metabolic factors, and drugs. Gallstones still remain the most common cause of pancreatitis. (Kasper, p. 1896)
31. (A) In benign gastric ulcer, an ulcer niche is present in the prepyloric area, with folds radiating to and extending up to the margin of the niche with a halo around it. The differentiation between benignity and malignancy may be difficult at times, but proper use of radiographic criteria could boost the accuracy to $98 \%$. In the presence of an ulcer niche, a Hampton line, which is an ulcer collar, or a mound should be sought on a profile view. Endoscopy with biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis. (Kasper, p. 1752)
32. (D) Helicobacter pylori infection is the cause of most peptic ulcers, and the usual route of infection is via the water supply. Duodenal ulcer is clinically more common, although the prevalence on autopsy series is similar. Duodenal ulcer does not represent a malignant potential. Gastric ulcers are seen in an older population and can be malignant. Benign peptic gastric ulcers tend to be more distal. (Kasper, pp. 1748-1749)
33. (E) Sugarless gums and candy often contain sorbitol, a sugar that is not absorbed in the gut. It thus produces an osmotic diarrhea if present in sufficient quantity. (Kasper, p. 228)
34. (D) Infection usually occurs early in life and is related to classic socioeconomic indicators such as poverty, domestic crowding, unsanitary living conditions, and unclean water. It is much more common in developing countries. (Kasper, p. 1749)
35. (D) Concomitant steroid use increases the likelihood of ulceration, as does advanced age H. pylori infection, smoking, and alcohol use are suspected, but not yet established, risk factors. (Kasper, p. 1751)
36. (E) NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, which play an important role in maintaining gastroduodenal mucosal integrity and repair. (Kasper, p. 1751)
37. (D) Eradication of H. pylori is the most effective treatment for duodenal ulcer disease. The most popular regimes include antibiotics and acid suppression medications. (Kasper, p. 1754)
38. (A, B) Specific vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B. Hepatitis D is most frequently symptomatic in association with hepatitis B infection, so vaccination for hepatitis B will decrease the likelihood of symptomatic hepatitis D infection. (Kasper, p. 1836)
39. (A, E) Both hepatitis $A$ and $E$ are usually spread by the fecal-oral route. Other forms of transmission are exceedingly uncommon. (Kasper, p. 1829)
40. (B, D) Only hepatitis B and D are frequently spread by sexual transmission. It does not seem to occur with hepatitis E, and the evidence is equivocal for hepatitis A and C. (Kasper, p. 1829)
41. (C) Chronic hepatitis $C$ infection occurs in $80-90 \%$ of patients. About $50-70 \%$ will have evidence of chronic liver disease. In contrast, only $1-10 \%$ of adults infected with hepatitis B will go on to chronic infection. (Kasper, p. 1829)
42. (B, C) Interferon has been used in both hepatitis B and C infection. The response is better in hepatitis $B$ infection. Combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin is more effective in hepatitis C. (Kasper, p. 1829)43. (B) In neonates, the transmission of hepatitis B results in a $90 \%$ probability of developing chronic infection. The ongoing infection (often resulting in hepatoma) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world. (Kasper, p. 1829)
44. (A, B) Immunoglobulin injection can provide prophylaxis against hepatitis A , and it is felt that hepatitis B immune globulin is protective for hepatitis B. (Kasper, p. 1829)
45. (D) Hepatitis D is a defective ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that requires the helper function of hepatitis B virus (or other hepadnavirus) for its replication and expression. (Kasper, p. 1826)
46. (C) Hyperglycemia is very common in pancreatitis and is usually multifactorial in origin. Factors involved include decreased insulin release, increased glucagon release, and elevated adrenal glucocorticoids and catecholamines. (Kasper, p. 1897)
47. (B) The sclera are high in elastin content, which has an affinity for bilirubin. Therefore, jaundice is usually detected here first. Fluorescent lighting makes recognition more difficult. In some individuals, dark skin color makes jaundice more difficult to detect. (Kasper, p. 238)
48. (A) Hemolysis results in predominantly unconjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is caused by overproduction, decreased uptake, or decreased conjugation. (Kasper, p. 240)
49. (E) Ménétrier's disease, an uncommon disease involving the stomach, is characterized by large gastric folds. Intravenous administration of radioactive-labeled albumin may show up to a $40 \%$ loss in the GI tract in protein-losing enteropathy, but is not available for routine clinical use. Treatment of protein-losing enteropathy is usually directed at the underlying condition. (Kasper, p. 1762)
50. (D) Joint involvement in inflammatory bowel disease may involve sacroiliitis or specific large joint peripheral arthritis. The latter type of
arthritis parallels the course of the bowel disease. The sacroiliitis (spondylitic) variety follows an independent course. (Kasper, p. 1786)
51. (D) This likely represents diarrhea secondary to Clostridium difficile infection. It is mediated by toxins, not by direct bacterial invasion. Cephalosporins, because they are so widely used, are the most common cause of the disease. On a per case basis, however, clindamycin is the most likely antibiotic to cause the disease. (Kasper, p. 760)
52. (E) The patient with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is typically a middle-aged woman with itching. Patients are often asymptomatic and diagnosed only on routine blood work. The cause of PBC is unknown, but a disordered immune response may be involved. A positive antimitochondrial antibody test is found in over $90 \%$ of symptomatic patients. (Kasper, p. 1861)
53. (B) Postgastrectomy steatorrhea does not result from mucosal abnormality. The mucosa is also normal in pancreatic steatorrhea. Postgastrectomy maldigestion and malabsorption is caused by rapid gastric emptying, reduced dispersion of food in the stomach, reduced luminal levels of bile, rapid transit of food, and impaired pancreatic secretory response. (Kasper, p. 1770)
54. (A) The string sign represents long areas of circumferential inflammation and fibrosis. It is seen in the stenotic and nonstenotic phase of Crohn's disease. In addition to the string sign, abnormal puddling of barium and fistulous tracts are other helpful x-ray signs of ileitis. Other radiologic findings in Crohn's disease include skip lesions, rectal sparing, small ulcerations, and fistulas. (Kasper, p. 1781)
55. (A) Although carcinoid tumor can cause diarrhea, it is very uncommon. This young woman is overweight, suggesting an eating disorder, which is associated with laxative abuse. Abuse of stimulant laxatives such as senna can cause a secretory diarrhea. Magnesium-based laxatives will cause an osmotic diarrhea. (Kasper, p. 228)56. (A) Colonic obstruction usually causes less pain and vomiting than small bowel obstruction. Fever is usually absent in both. The stepladder pattern is characteristic of small bowel obstruction, as are hiccups. (Kasper, p. 1804)
57. (C) Episodic dysphagia to solids of several years' duration suggests a benign disease, and is characteristic of a lower esophageal ring. Motor dysphagia presents with dysphagia to solids and liquids. Dysphagia due to obstruction starts with solids and can progress to liquids as well. Hoarseness following the onset of dysphagia can be caused by an esophageal cancer extending to involve the recurrent laryngeal nerve or because of laryngitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Severe weight loss suggests malignancy, and hiccups are a rare occurrence in distal problems of the esophagus. (Kasper, p. 217)
58. (E) Aspiration, unrelated to swallowing, is seen in a Zenker's diverticulum, achalasia, or gastroesophageal reflex. (Kasper, p. 217)
59. (D) Painful swallowing can be caused by candida or herpes infection or pill-induced esophagitis. Patients with immunodeficiency states (e.g., AIDS) may have herpetic, candidal, or CMV esophagitis, as well as tumors (lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma). (Kasper, p. 219)
60. (D) There is no known effective therapy to prevent progression of liver disease in PBC. In patients with end-stage liver failure, liver transplantation is "curative," since recurrence after transplantation is rare. The other therapies listed have been reported as effective in small case series but not in controlled trials. Ursodeoxycholic acid seems effective in providing at least symptomatic improvement, and may even delay liver transplantation. Replacement of fat-soluble vitamins (e.g., vita$\min A$ to prevent night blindness) is an important part of therapy, as is replacement of calcium and vitamin D to prevent osteoporosis. (Kasper, p. 1861)
61. (D) The history is helpful. The site of obstruction is usually at or below where the patient says the sticking occurs. (Kasper, p. 218)
62. (B) Severe chest pain is characteristic of diffuse esophageal spasm and related motor disorders. The symptoms can mimic that of cardiac chest pain and can be difficult to distinguish one from the other, since both conditions respond to nitrates. Cardiac conditions should be ruled out before noncardiac conditions are considered. (Kasper, p. 1742)
63. (E) Rotor's syndrome is one of the two rare inherited disorders causing elevations in direct bilirubin. The other is Dubin-Johnson syndrome, and both have an excellent prognosis. Hemolytic anemia causes elevation in indirect bilirubin, and hematologic changes would be expected. INH causes elevation in liver enzymes, and although Rifampin can cause isolated hyperbilirubinemia, it is of the indirect kind. CriglerNajjar type I is a severe disorder of neonates with elevated indirect bilirubin. (Kasper, p. 240)
64. (B) In alcoholic hepatitis, the AST:ALT ratio is usually $>2$, and the level of AST is usually $<300$. When viral hepatitis or toxin-induced hepatitis causes jaundice, the AST:ALT ratio is usually 1 or less, and the transaminases are usually $>500$. (Kasper, p. 241)
65. (D) Acetaminophen reliably produces hepatocellular damage when taken in large doses. Daily doses should not exceed 4 g a day, and accidental or intentional overdoses of 10-15 g will result in liver injury. Fatal fulminant disease is usually seen with ingestions over 25 g . (Kasper, pp. 1840-1841)
66. (B) An active metabolite of acetaminophen is hepatotoxic. It is detoxified by binding to glutathione, and when hepatic glutathione stores are depleted, severe liver damage can occur. (Kasper, pp. 1840-1841)67. (A) Anabolic steroids usually cause cholestasis and jaundice without inflammation. Sinusoidal dilatation and peliosis occur less frequently, and there have been deaths linked to peliosis. The other medications also cause various types of liver disease, but not peliosis. (Kasper, p. 1843)
68. (D) $N$-acetylcysteine probably acts by providing a reservoir of sulfhydryl groups to bind the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen. Narcan is effective for narcotic overdose, and ethanol is the antidote for methanol intoxication. (Kasper, p. 1841)
69. (D) Secretory diarrhea is caused by a derangement in fluid and electrolyte transport across the gut mucosa. The resultant diarrhea is watery, large volume, painless, and persists even when the patient fasts. (Kasper, p. 228)
70. (A) His anemia and general appearance are compatible with chronic inflammatory bowel disease as well, but his night blindness suggests vitamin A deficiency, which is much more likely in a malabsorption syndrome. (Kasper, p. 1768)
71. (E) The osmotic gap is a characteristic of osmotic diarrhea in particular. Stool fat, D-xylose testing, and Schilling tests help establish the diagnosis of malabsorption, but not the etiology. The most common cause of such diffuse malabsorption, celiac disease, has a characteristic biopsy pattern with short or absent villi. Confirmation of the disease requires response to a gluten-free diet. (Kasper, p. 1770)
72. (C) Acute erosive gastritis is most commonly seen in critically ill hospitalized patients. Ischemia of the gastric mucosa with breakdown of the normal protective barriers of the stomach is a key factor in the syndrome. (Kasper, p. 1760)
73. (D) Type B chronic gastritis is a more common cause of chronic gastritis. It becomes more common with advancing age and is uniformly associated with H. pylori infection. Eradication of $H$. pylori produces histologic improvement, but is not routinely recommended unless peptic ulcer or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma occurs. (Kasper, p. 1761)
74. (B) Type A chronic gastritis may lead to pernicious anemia. Antibodies to parietal cells and to intrinsic factor are frequently seen in the sera, suggesting an immune or autoimmune pathogenesis. These patients can also have autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo. (Kasper, p. 1761)
75. (E) Ménétrier's disease is not a true gastritis, as inflammation is not present on histologic examination. It is characterized by large, tortuous gastric mucosal folds and usually presents with abdominal pain. Protein-losing enteropathy often develops, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and edema. (Kasper, p.1762)
76. (A) Gastric surgery seems to accelerate the development of asymptomatic gastritis with progressive parietal cell loss. However, some patients develop bile reflux gastritis with symptoms of pain, nausea, and vomiting. (Kasper, p. 1757)# Hematology Questions

1. (D) The symptoms are typical of cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulins are antibodies that precipitate under cold conditions and are associated with several diseases. There are three main types of cryoglobulin syndromes based on the immunoglobulin composition of the precipitating antibody. Most cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is Type II or mixed and seen secondary to hepatitis $C$ virus infection. Cold agglutinin disease would present with hemolytic anemia. The other syndromes would not generally be temperature sensitive. (Lichtman, pp. 1857-1858)
2. (E) The syndrome is caused by cold-precipitable proteins (cryoglobulins) that are found in plasma or serum. These cryoproteins can be of three classes. Type 1 are single component (immunoglobulin G, M, or A [IgG, IgM, IgA]), Type 2 are called "mixed cryoglobulins" (usually IgG molecules complexed with IgM molecules having anti-IgG reactivity), and Type 3 are polyclonal immunoglobulins with antiimmunoglobulin activity. Cryoglobulinemia is small vessel vasculitis (not medium), and platelet aggregation is not an important mechanism for the vessel injury. (Lichtman, pp. 1857-1858)
3. (D) Auer bodies are slender, pink, staining rods containing lysozyme, and are exclusively seen in AML. Although similar to normal azurophilic granules in content and staining properties, they are distinguished by their gigantic size. Special stains can enhance the detection of Auer bodies. They are only seen in a minority of cases. The Philadelphia chromosome is a feature of choric myelogenous leukemia (CML), and a high leukocyte alkaline
phosphatase level is seen in patients with a high WBC due to a leukemoid reaction. (Lichtman, pp. 1186, 1192)
4. (B) This is a case of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The reciprocal translocation involves the long arms of 22 and 9 , and results in translocation of the ABL proto-oncogene from chromosome 9 adjacent to a portion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22. The resultant abnormal chromosome 22 is known as the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome. (Lichtman, pp. 1244-1245)
5. (A) An increased amount of HbF or HbA2 would be expected. As beta-chains are decreased in beta-thalassemia, the excess alpha-chains combine with gamma- and delta-chains to make HbF and HbA2, respectively. (Lichtman, p. 652)
6. (A) Graft-versus-host disease is a frequent complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation. It is caused by a reaction of immunologically competent donor derived T cells that react with recipient tissue antigens. It can be acute or chronic. Numerous treatment regimens involving methotrexate, glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, and other drugs are used in treatment. (Lichtman, pp. 309-312)
7. (B) In hemophilia A, there are decreased levels of functioning factor VIII. This can be due to reduced amounts of normal VIII, the presence of a functionally abnormal protein, or a combination of both. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is prolonged, and the prothrombin consumption test is abnormal. The prothrombin time, thrombin clotting time,and bleeding time are usually normal. (Lichtman, pp. 1870-1871)
8. (E) Hypernephroma, cerebellar hemangiomas, hepatoma, and giant uterine myomas are the tumors associated with secondary polycythemia. Endocrine disorders, hypoxia, and high-affinity hemoglobins can also cause secondary polycythemia. (Lichtman, pp. 781-786)
9. (C) Heterophil antibodies react against sheep red cells and are not absorbed out by the guinea pig kidney. They are positive in patients with infectious mononucleosis. In $90 \%$ of cases, liver enzymes are elevated. Examination of the blood film reveals a lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. (Lichtman, p. 1137)
10. (A, D, I) Hemoglobin $C$ is abnormal hemoglobin where lysine has been substituted for glutamic acid at the sixth position of the beta-chain. Homozygous C red cells are often target-shaped with "extra" membrane to make them less osmotically fragile. However, cells containing principally HbC are more rigid than normal and their fragmentation in the circulation may result in microspherocytes. Intracellular crystals and oxygenated HbC can be seen. The spleen is invariably enlarged. Women can become pregnant and tolerate the pregnancy well. (Lichtman, p. 684)
11. (B, F, J) Bone lesions in myeloma are destructive, but the alkaline phosphatase is usually normal, indicating little blastic activity. Osteolysis, when combined with immobilization, can lead to hypercalcemia. It is usually mediated by an osteoclast-activating factor from neoplastic myeloma cells in the adjacent marrow. Bone pain can be severe. Bence Jones proteinuria and myeloma cells in the marrow are typical. If cryoglobulinemia occurs, it is type I. (Lichtman, pp. 1505-1506)
12. (A, D, L) Hemolytic anemias are not associated with erythroid hypoplasia of the marrow. Erythroid hyperplasia is present except during infections or insults that lead to regenerative
crises. As a result, there is usually an increased number of reticulocytes and elevated fecal and urinary urobilinogen. Decreased RBC survival is a hallmark of the disease. (Lichtman, pp. 405-408)
13. (B, H, K) Microcytic hypochromic anemias are caused by disorders of iron, globin, heme, or porphyrin metabolism and are not seen in thiamine deficiency. (Lichtman, pp. 526-527)
14. (D, F, K) Postsplenectomy thrombocytosis usually resolves within 2 months. Both acute blood loss and chronic iron deficiency can increase platelets. Hemolytic anemia is associated with both increased reticulocytes and thrombocytosis. Thromboembolic or hemorrhagic phenomena are more common in essential thrombocytosis rather than secondary causes. (Lichtman, p. 1785)
15. (C) Iron chelation with desferrioxamine will reduce the toxicity from iron overload if given regularly in high doses. The most lethal toxicity of iron load is iron infiltration of the myocardium, with resultant dysfunction and death. (Lichtman, p. 657)
16. (C) Bone marrow examination is most likely to show increased erythroid-to-myeloid ratio. Erythroid hyperplasia is common to all hemolytic anemias, and megaloblastic features may develop unless folate is supplied. (Lichtman, p. 737)
17. (C) The present treatment of choice for thalassemia minor is purely supportive. Care is taken to watch for anemia during intercurrent illness, due to a regenerative crisis. (Lichtman, pp. 657-658)
18. (E) Reactive thrombocytosis is usually transitory, without thromboembolism, hemorrhage, splenomegaly, or leukocytosis. Causes of secondary thrombocytosis include chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), acute inflammatory disease, acute or chronic blood loss, and malignancy. Recovery from thrombocytopenia ("rebound") can also result in very high platelets. A common cause is withdrawal from alcohol. (Lichtman, pp. 1786-1787)19. (E) Steroids cause decreased numbers of eosinophils to circulate, so that eosinophilia may be seen in Addison's disease, for example. Beta-blockers may cause eosinophilia by blocking beta-adrenergic eosinopenia. Atopic and nonatopic chronic asthma are frequently associated with mild eosinophilia. Numerous allergic diseases, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria can also cause eosinophilia. Parasites are the most common worldwide cause of eosinophilia, but other infections rarely cause it. (Lichtman, pp. 869, 870)
20. (D) Febrile reactions to leukocytes may be severe and cause hypotension, especially in repeatedly transfused patients. Antibodies to platelets can also develop. Usually, at least seven transfusions are required to induce sensitization. (Lichtman, pp. 2166-2167)
21. (C) The painful crisis seen in patients with sickle cell disease is due to vaso-occlusive disease where microvascular ischemic injury occurs to tissues. Acute illness, dehydration, and infections are common precipitants for this type of crisis. Because sickle cell anemia is a chronic hemolytic anemia, the reticulocyte is chronically elevated, except in aplastic crises, and erythrocyte life span is shortened. Infection is the most common precipitant of an aplastic crisis, particularly those caused by parvovirus B19. Sequestration crisis (hemoglobin level $<6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is sudden massive pooling of red cells in the spleen resulting in hemodynamic instability. Hemolytic crisis is the sudden further reduction in red cell life span marked by falling hemoglobin, jaundice, and increased reticulocyte count. (Lichtman, p. 675)
22. (E) A serum ferritin determination would be most helpful. Iron stores in thalassemia are normal or increased. Some of the increase may be secondary to injudicious iron therapy. (Lichtman, pp. 527-528)
23. (E) The diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia requires demonstration of immunoglobulin and/or complement in the patient's RBC. The broad-spectrum Coombs' test is an excellent screen. (Lichtman, p. 729)
24. (C) Clopidogrel selectively inhibits platelet activation induced by ADP. It works as an ADP-receptor blocker. Other antiplatelet drugs such as ASA are COX-1 inhibitors, and dipyridamole modulates cAMP levels. (Lichtman, pp. 291-293)
25. (B) Heparin appears to act as catalyst in the inactivation of thrombin and factors XA, IXA, XIA, and by antithrombin III. However, not all patients with thrombosis and heparin resistance have antithrombin III deficiency. (Lichtman, pp. 1988-1989)
26. (A) Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in infancy. Sixty percent of body iron concentration at birth is contained in circulating Hb . Milk is a poor source of iron, so the most common cause of iron deficiency in infancy is prolonged breast or bottle feeding. Cereals are high in iron content. (Lichtman, pp. 520-521)
27. (C) The 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds to the central cavity of the heme molecule and changes the configuration in favor of oxygen release. The other common factors that affect oxygen affinity are temperature and pH . The oxygen affinity of Hb is easily characterized by P50; the oxygen tension at which Hb is half-saturated. (Lichtman, p. 606)
28. (B) Group $A B$ has neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies, as both $A$ and $B$ antigens are on the red cells. Persons with type $A B$ blood are considered "universal recipients." It is a rare blood group (only $2-3 \%$ of population); if large amounts of blood are required in an $A B$ individual, any type of blood ( $A, A B, B, O$ ) can be used as long as the plasma is removed from the donor blood (in other words packed RBCs are used). (Kasper, pp. 662-664)
29. (B) There is lytic destruction of the 6th rib with a pathologic fracture and an extrapleural mass. The most common manifestation of multiple myeloma is multiple, "punched-out" lesions in the flat and tubular bones. Some may appear as discrete lytic lesions and remain as solitary lesions. (Lichtman, p. 1510)30. (A) The diagnosis is AVN of the femoral head. Bone complications occur frequently in patients with sickle cell anemia. Infarcted areas of bone and bone marrow can become sites of infection (osteomyelitis) with Staphylococcus aureus or salmonella, but the lack of fever and clinical signs in this patient suggest AVN. Infarction of the femoral head nutrient artery leads to AVN and chronic joint pain. The humeral head is also at risk of AVN. Septic arthritis is a less common complication. (Lichtman, p. 676)
31. (E) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is the most likely diagnosis. Spherocytosis is seen as well in burn victims, in microangiopathic hemolysis, and in congenital spherocytosis. (Lichtman, p. 737)
32. (E) Clopidogrel is an ADP-receptor blocker, and inhibits platelet activation induced by ADP. This results in a prolongation of bleeding time that is greater than that produced by acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). The effects last for 4-10 days after discontinuation. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that relies on an active metabolite for its effect, and is marginally more effective than ASA for certain conditions like stroke and acute coronary syndrome. The effect on bleeding time is additive to that of ASA. (Lichtman, p. 292)
33. (F) Fish oils cause a slight prolongation of the bleeding time. The mechanism is twofold: they reduce platelet arachidonic acid, and as well they compete with arachidonic acid for cyclooxygenase. Other foods that may affect platelet function include garlic, onions, and black tree fungus (found in Chinese cuisine). (Lichtman, p. 1838)

34 (C) A number of factors influence the rate and degree of HbS aggregation, including concentration of HbS in the cell, cellular dehydration, and the length of time in deoxyconformation. (Lichtman, p. 672)
35. (D) The patients with homozygous HbC disease have mild hemolysis, splenomegaly, target cells, and HbC crystals. Unlike sickle cell disease, the prognosis is favorable. (Lichtman, pp. 684-685)
36. (A) In beta-thalassemia, there is excess production of alpha-chains, which precipitate and destroy red cell precursors. (Lichtman, p. 633)
37. (B) HbH (four beta-chains) most commonly results from the compound heterozygous state for alpha-plus-thalassemia and either deletion or nondeletion alpha-plus-thalassemia. However, the phenotypic expression of the disease is quite variable. (Lichtman, p. 651)
38. (C) If the bone infarction occurs in proximity to a joint, an effusion can develop. The underlying pathology is a vaso-occlusive phenomenon. Bone infarction can appear like osteomyelitis (radiographically and clinically), which is problematic since patients with sickle cell disease are also at increased risk of osteomyelitis. (Lichtman, p. 676)
39. (A, J) Neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting side effect of vincristine. Neurologic toxicity is usually the result of a cumulative dose and usually begins when the total dose exceeds $6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Paresthesia of fingers and feet and loss of deep tendon reflexes are the usual initial manifestation. Continual administration may lead to severe motor weakness, particularly in the elderly. Constipation can also occur as a result of autonomic neuropathy. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) with hyponatremia can occur. (Lichtman, pp. 256-257)
40. (C, F) The renal concentrating defect and positive sickle prep are constant, but occlusive phenomena in the kidney can result in hematuria from papillary necrosis. This occurs when the red cells are prone to sickle cell formation under hypoxic stress. (Lichtman, pp. 676-677)
41. (I) The megaloblastic anemia of pregnancy is the most common of all folate-deficient states. Dilutional anemia and iron deficiency also occur in pregnancy. In pregnancy, a low Hb concentration may simply be due to a disproportionate increase in plasma volume, rather than a true anemia. The exact hormonal mechanism is unknown. Folate levels fall during pregnancy; therefore, frank deficiency is most common in the third trimester. (Lichtman, p. 489)42. (C) Chorionic villus sampling in the first trimester with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)based diagnosis has a high degree of accuracy. Cord blood electrophoresis is suitable for screening high-risk infants at birth. (Lichtman, p. 659)
43. (C) Spherocytes are seen on the blood film in patients with moderate to severe hemolytic anemia. This patient has autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to cold agglutinins related the pneumonia. Spherocytosis is not associated with G6PD deficiency, trauma, or leukemia. The typical changes in G6PD deficiency include the presence of Heinz bodies. The cell morphology is not usually changed unless hemolysis is very severe. In hereditary spherocytosis, the Coombs' test is negative. (Lichtman, p. 737)
44. (A) Testing the mother for the presence of $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$ antibodies (alloimmunization) is done by indirect Coombs' test of the maternal serum with known $\mathrm{Rh}(\mathrm{D})$ positive cells. Prevention of Rh immunization by the administration of Rh antibody (via Rh immune globulin) has been an effective preventive measure for this disorder. This condition is usually associated with a positive Coombs' test using the baby's RBCs and a positive indirect Coombs' test using the mother's serum. ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn is clinically mild because the antigens are not fully expressed in utero. (Lichtman, p. 751)
45. (D) This patient has hairy cell leukemia, which is a rare form of adult of leukemia ( $2-3 \%$ ). The disease is characterized by "hairy" cells in blood and bone marrow, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. The lymphocytes have characteristic cytoplasmic projections, which give the disease its name. Treatment with the purine analogue, such as cladribine, produces complete remission in hairy cell leukemia. Recombinant alphainterferon is not as effective. (Lichtman, p. 1385)
46. (D) Supportive footwear will decrease the likelihood of "march" hemolysis, but this rarely causes anemia. Similarly, although $20 \%$ of longdistance runners have GI blood loss, this is rarely of a magnitude to explain anemia. Most
elite athletes have increases in both plasma volume and red cell mass, but the increase in plasma volume is greater, resulting in a dilutional-type anemia. This is physiologically beneficial (increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport with increased blood fluidity), so there is no reason to cease exercising to correct the Hb. (Lichtman, p. 415)
47. (A) Alcohol is directly toxic to dividing and maturing cells, but may also affect neutrophil function. The hematologic effects of alcohol may be direct or indirect, via diet, infection, liver disease, and GI disease. The resulting hematologic abnormalities may be profound. (Lichtman, pp. 557-558)
48. (E) HbF is evenly distributed among red cells, unlike the increased F in other conditions. It is a heterogeneous condition, and can be classified into deletion and nondeletion forms. Clinically, it can have features similar to mild thalassemia. (Lichtman, p. 655)
49. (E) The spleen normally functions to pit nuclei and their fragments from red cells. These nuclear fragments are called Howell-Jolly bodies. The spleen has immune functions and filter functions. It also enhances iron reutilization, and acts as a reservoir and blood-volume regulator. In disease states, it can be a site of extramedullary hematopoiesis. (Lichtman, p. 777)
50. (D) Anti-A and anti-B in the donor plasma are usually absorbed in the recipient's tissues but have the capacity to harm recipient cells. (Lichtman, p. 2165)
51. (B) In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a bone marrow analysis is the most important test in confirming the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of ALL is established, CSF fluid (leukemic cells in the CSF can be identified in up to a third of all patients at diagnosis) and CXR are important tests in the workup of the patient. It is the most common malignancy in children under age 15 in the United States, accounting for $25 \%$ of all cancers in White children. It is less common in Black children. (Lichtman, pp. 1324-1326)52. (E) This patient has autoimmune hemolysis and the red cell destruction is extravascular, usually occurring in the liver, spleen, or other reticuloendothelial sites. It liberates unconjugated bilirubin causing jaundice. Intrinsic causes of hemolytic anemia are usually inherited, and are a result of abnormalities of membranes, red cell enzymes, globins, or heme. Extrinsic hemolysis is a result of mechanical forces, chemicals or microorganisms, antibodies, or sequestration in the monocyte-macrophage system. (Lichtman, pp. 406-407)
53. (C) In hemolytic anemia the haptoglobin is decreased, reticulocyte count increased, and unconjugated bilirubin increased. There is no bilirubin in the urine because unconjugated bilirubin is not cleared by the kidney as it is tightly bound to plasma proteins. (Lichtman, p. 737)
54. (D) Anemia is usually multifactorial in alcoholics and includes marrow suppression, GI bleeding, hemorrhagic diathesis, and nutritional deficiency. (Lichtman, pp. 557-558)
55. (B) The macrocytosis and hypersegmented neutrophils suggests a megaloblastic anemia due to either folate or vitamin $B_{12}$ deficiency. Folate deficiency results from decreased intake and malabsorption. Body folate stores are meager (only 3 months on average, compared to a few years for vitamin $B_{12}$ ), and therefore easily depleted when intake is poor. Alcohol itself can depress folate levels acutely, and also can cause pancytopenia directly. (Lichtman, pp. 477, 488)
56. (A) Macrocytosis is frequently seen in patients with chronic alcoholism for multiple reasons including vitamin $B_{12}$ or folate deficiency, chronic liver disease, and also from the direct toxic effects of alcohol on red cells. Because both iron deficiency and folate deficiency are very common in alcoholics, a dimorphic blood film can also be seen (macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, and hypochromic microcytes can be found) on the same slide. (Lichtman, pp. 557-558)
57. (D) Coagulation factors II, V, VII, IX, X, and XI would most likely be deficient. These are some of the factors that are synthesized in the liver. Factors II, VII, IX, and X are the vitamin Kdependent factors, which are also synthesized in the liver. (Lichtman, p. 1953)
58. (B) Thalassemia minor usually represents a heterozygous state and is often asymptomatic. Symptoms may develop during periods of stress such as pregnancy or severe infection. Hemoglobin values are usually in the $9-11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ range. The red cells are small and poorly hemoglobinized. (Lichtman, p. 651)
59. (D) HbC characteristically produces targeting in the peripheral blood and also hemoglobin crystals in the cells. HbC is found in 17-28\% of West Africans. Splenomegaly is a fairly constant feature, but most patients are quite asymptomatic. (Lichtman, p. 684)
60. (D) Sideroblastic anemia is associated with an increased serum iron and ferritin. TIBC is generally normal. HbA2 is usually decreased. (Lichtman, pp. 823-825)
61. (B) The beta-thalassemia trait is characterized by normal iron studies and an elevated HbA2. (Lichtman, p. 652)
62. (A) Iron deficiency is characterized by low serum iron and ferritin and an increase in TIBC. HbA2 is normal. (Lichtman, pp. 524-526)
63. (C) Anemia of chronic disease is characterized by decreased serum iron and TIBC, an elevated ferritin, and normal HbA2. (Lichtman, pp. 567-568)
64. (D) Erythroid precursors that have accumulated abnormal amounts of iron are called ringed sideroblasts. Sideroblastic anemia can be either inherited or acquired. Common acquired causes are ingestion of certain drugs, alcohol, or toxins such as lead or zinc. The beta-thalassemia trait is diagnosed by demonstrating an elevated HbA2, iron deficiency by iron studies and ferritin levels, and anemia of chronic disease by demonstratinga chronic disease. Sideroblastic anemia generally requires a bone marrow aspiration revealing ringed sideroblasts for diagnosis. (Lichtman, p. 823)
65. (D) Burr cells and stomatocytes are found in severe liver disease and might result from abnormal membrane lipids. (Lichtman, pp. 15-16)
66. (F) Heinz bodies (precipitated Hb ) are found in disorders with unstable Hb or after oxidant stress. (Lichtman, pp. 15-16)
67. (A) Spherocytes are caused by loss of membrane, as in hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. (Lichtman, pp. 15-16)
68. (C) Sickle cell disease results in polymerization of HbS and the characteristic sickle cells. (Lichtman, pp. 15-16)
69. (B) Schistocytes are caused by traumatic disruption of the red cell membrane (e.g., microangiopathic syndromes). (Lichtman, pp. 15-16)
70. (A) von Willebrand's disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. The abnormal plasma glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (vWF), has two major functions: facilitating
platelet adhesion and serving as a carrier for factor VIII. The disease is heterogeneous in its manifestations but can be very severe (type III disease). Evaluation reveals a prolonged bleeding time and decreased factor VIII activity. (Lichtman, pp. 1935-1937)
71. (B) Hemophilia A results from a deficiency or dysfunction of the factor VIII molecule. It is a sex-linked disease affecting 1 in 10,000 males. The PTT is prolonged, but the bleeding time is characteristically normal. (Lichtman, pp. 1870-1874)
72. (C) Hemophilia B is clinically indistinguishable from hemophilia A and is also inherited via the $X$ chromosome. The bleeding time is usually normal, but the PTT is usually elevated. Differentiation from hemophilia A requires factor assay. (Lichtman, pp. 1880-1881)
73. (D) TTP is a fulminant disorder that can be fatal. It has been associated with malignancy, pregnancy, metastatic cancer, and high-dose chemotherapy. Most often, the classical tests of hemostasis and platelet function are normal. The classical symptoms include fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and fluctuating neurologic defects. (Lichtman, p. 2034)# Oncology <br> Questions

60. A 52-year-old woman has metastatic breast cancer with boney metastases. She is taking hydromorphone for the pain but is still experiencing back pain. She is reluctant to take more of the hydromorphone since she become very drowsy with higher doses. This group of medications is particularly useful for pain from bony metastases. (SELECT ONE)
61. A 74-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer develops shooting pains in his left leg
and constant back pain. Further evaluation reveals a pathologic compression fracture of the lumbar spine and involvement of the nerve roots in his lower spine causing the pain. He is started on a medication to help reduce the symptoms, but a limitation of the drug is leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. (SELECT ONE)
62. A 68-year-old woman was treated for melanoma 3 years ago. She now presents with constant headaches, nausea, vomiting, and leftsided weakness. ACT scan reveals two masses in the right parietal lobe consistent with metastatic melanoma. She is started on medication to help reduce her symptoms of headaches and nausea. (SELECT ONE)
63. A 65-year-old man has metastatic lung cancer and severe bone and chest pain. He is started on morphine and ibuprofen to control the pain but is still not comfortable. Further gradual increases in the morphine dose achieve good pain control but he becomes drowsy on the appropriate dose and is unable to do much. He is started on a medication that can be useful in controlling opioid-induced sedation. (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (C) Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and stomach cancer. Associated immunoglobulin A (IgA) ( $\pm$ immunoglobulin E [IgE]) deficiency predisposes to infection as well. All the other conditions listed are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and a positive family history is much more likely. (Kasper, p. 2423)
2. (B) Only the chronic carrier state increases HCC risk, not previous infection. The majority, but not all, of HCC associated with HBV occurs in the setting of cirrhosis ( $60-90 \%$ ). Because the latency period of HBV infection is 35 years, before HCC supervenes, early-life infection is strongly correlated with HCC. The chronic carrier state of HBsAg in endemic areas, such as Taiwan, is associated with a relative risk of over 100 for the development of HCC. Over half the chronic carriers of HBsAg in such a population will die of cirrhosis or HCC. In Taiwan, where childhood vaccination was introduced in 1984, the death rate from childhood HCC has already declined. (Devita, pp. 533-534)
3. (B) Radiation-induced malignancies tend to occur at the age where that particular malignancy would normally occur. Therefore, the latency period can be 40 years or more. The latency period tends to be shortest (5-7 years) for leukemia. The risk for most malignancies is greatest with early-life radiation, and evidence suggests that therapeutic radiation confers excess risk as well. The amount of exposure determines the likelihood of developing malignancy, not its severity. (Devita, pp. 197-198)
4. (B) There is universal agreement on the need for regular Pap smears in young women. There is no need to screen for colon cancer (fecal occult blood) or lung tumors (CXR), particularly at this age. Mammography, if indicated for screening, would be only for older women. Many authorities recommend breast selfexamination as well as physical examination by a physician. (Kasper, pp. 444-446)
5. (C) All of the given responses are potential anterior mediastinal masses, but when an anterior mediastinal mass presents with myasthenia gravis the diagnosis of thymoma is essentially established. Myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic process of the thymoma. The ocular and muscle fatigue symptoms are characteristic of myasthenia. About $5-10 \%$ of patients with thymoma will also have hypogammaglobulinemia. About 5\% of patients with thymoma will have autoimmune pure red cell aplasia. (Kasper, pp. 2518-2523)
6. (D) The history of weight loss and dysphagia suggests carcinoma of the esophagus, and squamous cell carcinoma is a disease that occurs in older men who drink and smoke heavily. Smoking and or excessive drinking are considered etiologic factors in the development of squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas arise within dysplastic columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus, usually in the presence of chronic gastric reflux. (Kasper, pp. 523-524)
7. (A) Low dietary vitamin C, and high salt and nitrate consumption predispose to gastric cancer, as does ingestion of smoked foods. Smoking is a risk factor, but alcohol is not.H. pylori is another important risk factor, since it causes gastritis that eventually leads to chronic atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia, and then carcinoma. (Kasper, pp. 524-525)
8. (B) The most likely mode of action of methotrexate is by tightly binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which maintains the intracellular folate pool in its fully reduced form as tetrahydrofolates. These compounds are required in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and purines. (Kasper, p. 476)
9. (D) Adenocarcinoma is the most common cancer of the pancreas. The proximal pancreas is the most common site, with only $20 \%$ occurring in the body and $5-10 \%$ in the tail. About $95 \%$ of the tumors arise from the exocrine portion of the gland, and these are usually malignant. Most of the endocrine tumors are benign. Early development of metastases is characteristic of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. (Kasper, pp. 537-538)
10. (E) For most patients, the development of HCC is the first manifestation of their underlying liver disease. The most common presentation is with RUQ pain, mass, and weight loss, but hepatic decompensation with jaundice and ascites is also common. About $25 \%$ of patients have hepatic bruits. (Kasper, pp. 533-534)
11. (B) Adenocarcinoma, the most common malignancy of the small bowel, is most common proximally, particularly in the duodenum. Small bowel lymphomas are most common in the ileum, but the stomach is the most common site of GI lymphoma. Carcinoids usually present with local symptoms. Carcinoid syndrome is present only with hepatic metastases. Benign tumors bleed more frequently than malignant ones. Malignant adenocarcinomas can occur in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. (Kasper, pp. 531-533)
12. (E) Depth of tumor penetration (Dukes stage) is the most important prognostic factor in the 5 -year survival in patients with colon cancer. Rectal bleeding is a good prognostic sign, perhaps because surface erosion manifests early. Young age, male gender, and location in the rectum all indicate a poorer prognosis. Unlike
most tumors, no correlation with tumor size and prognosis has been established for colon cancer. (Kasper, pp. 527-531)
13. (B) Carcinoma of the cervix is common in young women. For endometrial cancer, the peak is from age 55 to 60 . Endometrial cancer is associated with nulliparity, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Cervical cancer is associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. There is tremendous variation in incidence of cervical cancer based on geography, ethnicity, and sexual history. (Kasper, pp. 556-557)
14. (B) Breast cancer risk is reduced by $20 \%$ for each year that menarche is delayed. Early menopause, natural or surgical, also decreases risk. Early (age 18 or 19) full-term pregnancy and multiparity decrease the risk. Radiation exposure is a risk factor primarily in adolescence and is marginal after the age of 40 . In summary, there are three important dates in the assessing the risk of breast cancer: age of menarche, age of first full-term pregnancy, and age of menopause. (Kasper, p. 517)
15. (E) The history of being a pipe fitter suggests asbestos exposure, and the CXR finding of pleural plaques and lower lobe fibrosis confirms prior asbestos exposure. The classic associated cancer is mesothelioma. However, in $30-50 \%$ of cases, no history of asbestos exposure is apparent. The average age on presentation is 60 , and this is typically many years after the exposure. The most common presenting symptoms are dyspnea and nonpleuritic chest pain. Smoking injury in patients with asbestos exposure increases the risk of other lung cancers such as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. (Kasper, pp. 1522-1523)
16. (A) Overwhelmingly, the major prognostic factor in osteosarcoma is location of the tumor. Pelvic and axial lesions do worse than those in the extremities, and survival is better in tibial tumors than femoral tumors. Lung metastases are very common. (Kasper, pp. 558-561)
17. (C) CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is part of the staging workup for patientswith HD. Other components of staging include CBC, lytes, LDH, CXR, and bone marrow biopsy. PET and gallium scanning are not always done, and are usually helpful at the completion of treatment to document remission. The purpose of staging laparotomy is to determine whether radiation alone will be used for treatment. As chemotherapy usage increases, the necessity for staging laparotomy decreases. (Kasper, pp. 654-655)
18. (C) The most characteristic presentation of Hodgkin's disease is that of enlarged, superficial cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes in a young person. The nodes are usually freely moveable, nontender, and not painful. Occult presentation with intrathoracic or intraabdominal disease is unusual. (Kasper, pp. 654-655)
19. (C) About $85 \%$ of low-grade lymphocytic lymphomas are widespread at the time of diagnosis. However, staging is still important as radiation therapy can be curative for localized (stage I, II) disease. Because the prognosis for this malignancy is measured in years, it has been difficult to demonstrate a survival benefit for aggressive chemotherapy. The poor prognosis for lymphoma in older patients might be a result of less-aggressive therapy. (Kasper, pp. 648-649)
20. (B) Cutaneous lymphomas are of T-cell origin and are more common in other parts of the world, such as Japan. Patients with adult T-cell lymphoma-leukemia (ATLL) have acute fulminant courses characterized by skin invasion and leukemic cells. This syndrome is clearly related to human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I), and there is a possibility that HTLV-I, or another retrovirus, might be the agent for mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. ATLL responds poorly to treatment and therapy for the lowgrade malignancies controls symptoms but does not result in cure. (Kasper, p. 653)
21. (B) Age, history of smoking, and polycythemia in a patient with hematuria strongly suggests a renal cell carcinoma. The elevated hemoglobin represents increased erythropoietin production and is not related to prognosis. Involvement along the renal vein and metastases to the lung
is also characteristic of renal cell carcinoma. Elevated liver enzymes and weight loss can represent nonmetastatic effects of malignancy and can reverse with resection. Almost half of patients will have a palpable abdominal mass on presentation. The CT of the thorax is a useful test because three-quarters of those with metastatic disease will have lung metastases. (Kasper, pp. 541-542)
22. (D) Breast-conserving surgery is now recommended for small tumors. Radiation therapy will decrease local recurrence rates. For tumors $<1 \mathrm{~cm}$, adjuvant therapy is indicated only if axillary nodes are positive. Therefore, in this case, an axillary dissection will provide important therapeutic information. However, this is an area of rapidly changing knowledge and practice. (Kasper, pp. 519-520)
23. (B) Patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin are typically elderly and have metastatic tumors at many sites. Generally, the prognosis is poor, but some subsets, in which effective treatment is available, can be identified by clinical criteria with only moderate investigations. These include peritoneal carcinomatosis in women (responds to treatment for ovarian cancer), predominant skeletal metastases in men (can reflect prostatic cancer), and women with axillary lymphadenopathy (can reflect breast cancer). In the latter scenario, studies for estrogen and progesterone receptors are very useful in guiding therapy. (Kasper, pp. 562-563)
24. (B) When men and women of all ages are considered, cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death. However, among women age 35-74 years, cancer is the leading cause of death. Lung cancer is the number one cause of death from cancer, when both men and women are considered. Men generally have higher incidence rates for cancer: breast, gallbladder, and thyroid cancers are the exceptions. It is felt that $75-80 \%$ of all cancers in the United States are due to environmental factors. The environmental contribution is estimated by comparing age-adjusted U.S. rates of specific cancers to the rates for the country with the lowest risk. (Devita, pp. 228-250)25. (B) Barrett's esophagus, characterized by a columnar cell-lined esophageal mucosa, is a major risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Although acid reflux may be a predisposing factor, there is no evidence that either medical or surgical antireflux measures alter the outcome. It is found in about $20 \%$ of patients undergoing endoscopy for esophagitis, and up to $50 \%$ may develop a malignancy. (Kasper, p. 222)
26. (D) Worldwide, the presence of liver flukes (e.g., Clonorchis sinensis) is the most likely predisposing factor for cholangiocarcinoma. Part of this increased risk is caused by the development of hepatolithiasis. The highest rate of cholangiocarcinoma is found in Southeast Asia. It is thought that liver flukes and a diet high in nitrosamine are the prime reasons for this. In North America, primary sclerosing cholangitis and chronic ulcerative colitis are the most common predisposing factors. Cholelithiasis, alcohol, smoking, and chronic hepatitis B are not known to be risk factors. (Kasper, p. 536)
27. (E) The size of the tumor is a prognostic factor, as is knowing menopausal status, endocrine receptor status, and lymph node involvement. These four factors are used to decide who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or tamoxifen treatment. (Kasper, pp. 520-522)
28. (A) Observation alone is adequate for this lesion. The "ABCD" rules are helpful in distinguishing benign skin lesions from malignant melanoma. (A) asymmetry, benign lesions are symmetric; (B) border irregular, most nevi have clear-cut borders; (C) color variation, benign lesions have uniform color; (D) diameter, $>6 \mathrm{~mm}$ is more likely to be malignant. In addition, recent rapid change in size is also helpful in distinguish benign from malignant lesions. Thickness of the tumor is the most important prognostic factor in the majority of cases, and ulceration indicates a more aggressive cancer with a poorer prognosis. Although cumulative sun exposure is a major factor in melanoma (e.g., more frequent near the equator), it cannot explain such things as the more common occurrence of some types in relatively young people. It is possible that brief, intense exposure to
sunlight may contribute to, or initiate, carcinogenic events. (Kasper, pp. 500-502)
29. (B) Prognosis of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is best assessed with the International Prognostic Index. It is an index with five clinical risk factors that helps to predict the 5-year survival. Poor prognostic factors are age $>60$ years, high serum LDH level, poor performance status (either Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] $>2$, or Karnofsky $<70$ ), Ann Arbor stage III or IV, or $>1$ extranodal involvement. (Kasper, p. 647)
30. (A) IgG spikes $>3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ or $\mathrm{IgA}>2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ strongly suggest myeloma rather than monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is suggested when the spike is $<3.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, the marrow has fewer than $10 \%$ plasma cells, and the Bence Jones proteinuria is $<1.0 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Depressed hemoglobin levels, elevated calcium levels, progressive bone lesions, and impaired renal function suggest more advanced stages of multiple myeloma. (Kasper, pp. 658-660)
31. (D) Native Americans of both sexes have low cancer rates, but cancer rates (for women) for stomach, biliary tract, cervix, and kidney are surprisingly high. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
32. (B) Whites have high rates for melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and lip cancer. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
33. (B) Whites have high rates for breast, corpus uteri, testis, bladder, brain, colon, and rectum cancer. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
34. (A) Although Hispanic Americans have relatively low cancer rates ( $66 \%$ of that for White Americans and $54 \%$ of that for Black Americans), they do have high rates for cancer of the cervix. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
35. (E) Chinese Americans have a rate of nasopharyngeal cancer 23 times greater than White Americans and liver cancer rates 7 times greater than White Americans. (Devita, pp. 228-240)36. (F) Japanese Americans have a threefold increase in stomach cancer rate compared to White Americans, but this is lower than rates in Japan. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
37. (C) The excess risk of cancers of the stomach, esophagus, lung, and cervix among Black Americans is diminished when socioeconomic variations are factored in. (Devita, pp. 228-240)
38. (A) Alcoholic beverages combine with tobacco smoking to increase cancer of the mouth and, by causing cirrhosis, can lead to liver cancer. (Devita, pp. 241-250)
39. (D) Asbestos exposure causes more deaths from lung cancer (two-fold increase) than from mesothelioma (hundredfold increase) because the latter tumor is so rare. (Devita, pp. 241-250)
40. (F) Sun exposure severe enough to cause sunburn is associated with increased risk of melanoma, whereas other skin cancers are more related to cumulative exposure. (Devita, pp. 241-250)
41. (I) Although causation is not definite, a high proportion of cervical cancers reveal HPV-16 and HPV-18 on biopsy. HPV has also been isolated from vulvar, penile, and anal cancers. (Devita, pp. 241-250)
42. (H) Cirrhosis, related to chronic HBV infection, is a leading cause of HCC. (Devita, pp. 241-250)
43. (C) Adenocarcinoma is now the most common form of lung cancer, accounting for $40 \%$ of the total cases. (Devita, p. 928)
44. (B) Because of its tendency for early exfoliation and obstruction, squamous cell cancer is often detected at an earlier stage. Even correcting for this, there is some suggestion that its prognosis is still better, perhaps because of its slow growth rate. (Devita, p. 928)
45. (B) Nonmetastatic hypercalcemia occurs in up to $15 \%$ of all squamous cell cancers due to the production of parathyroid hormone related
peptide (PTH-rP). This is a paraneoplastic phenomenon. (Devita, p. 933)
46. (D) SIADH occurs in up to $10 \%$ of all small cell cancers of the lung. SIADH, Cushing's syndrome, and neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes usually occur with small cell lung cancer, not nonsmall cell lung cancer. (Devita, p. 985)
47. (D) Eaton-Lambert syndrome is unusual, but small cell lung cancer causes the majority of cases that are paraneoplastic. (Devita, pp. 985, 2530)
48. (G) Cisplatin is used for the treatment of many different cancers including testicular cancer. Its major toxicities are renal, ototoxicity, myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy is dose- and duration-dependent. (Kasper, p. 475)
49. (A) Liver toxicity is most common when methotrexate is used on a daily basis, such as for psoriasis. Myelosuppression and GI mucositis are the most common side effects in cancer therapy. (Devita, p. 392)
50. (D) Although lung injury is the most serious complication of bleomycin, this unusual skin reaction is more frequent, occurring in almost $50 \%$ of patients. (Devita, pp. 453-454)
51. (E) Doxorubicin can cause a cumulative, dosedependent cardiomyopathy that can result in congestive heart failure. However, an acute, non-dose-related myocarditis-pericarditis can also occur. It can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, or pericardial effusions. (Devita, pp. 425-427)
52. (I) Cyclophosphamide causes hemorrhagic cystitis in up to $10 \%$ of patients because active metabolites are excreted. Adequate hydration and frequent urination can decrease the frequency of this complication. (Devita, pp. 363-365)
53. (D) Papillary cancer has the best prognosis of all thyroid cancers. Although it is seven times more common than follicular cancer, fewer people die from it. Even with follicular cancer, most patients will die of other diseases. In commonwith other thyroid cancers, age seems to be an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. (Devita, pp. 1746-1750)
54. (B) Although well-differentiated thyroid cancer is twice as common in Whites than in Blacks, the proportion that is follicular is more than twice as high in Blacks. (Devita, pp. 1746-1750)
55. (E) Serum calcitonin elevation is specific for medullary thyroid cancer and is the most specific tumor marker now available. When combined with provocative agents (e.g., calcium, pentagastrin), it is also very sensitive. In the familial syndrome, provocative tests have been superseded by genetic studies. (Devita, p. 1757)
56. (B) Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease is more common in women, and is particularly common in younger age groups but can occur at any age. (Devita, p. 2347)
57. (A) In lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease, multiple sections often have to be examined to find Reed-Sternberg cells. Some authorities question whether such cells are necessary for diagnosis of this form. Variants, often called lymphocytic and histiocytic (L\&H) or popcorn cells, are often frequently found. (Devita, p. 2345)
58. (A) Most patients with lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease have clinically localized disease and are asymptomatic; the prognosis is usually favorable. However, it accounts for only $4-5 \%$ of cases. (Devita, p. 2346)
59. (F) This is a frequent accompaniment of Hodgkin's disease and can be found in involved lymph nodes, and may be extensive enough to obscure the presence of Hodgkin's disease. Rather than evidence of occult involvement, the presence of granulomas implies stage for stage, a better prognosis than those without this reaction. (Devita, pp. 2344-2352)
60. (A) Prostaglandins play a role in bone resorption in metastatic disease, perhaps explaining the effectiveness of NSAIDs for this type of pain. Aspirin has been shown to have an antitumor effect in an animal bone tumor model. (Devita, p. 2992)
61. (D) Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant used widely as an adjuvant analgesic for neuralgic pain caused by either tumor infiltration or surgical nerve injury. Because cancer patients commonly have compromised hematologic reserve, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia caused by carbamazepine may limit its use. (Devita, pp. 2993, 2999)
62. (G) Steroids are useful for controlling pain in patients with leptomeningeal metastases or headache from increased intracranial pressure. (Devita, p. 3000)
63. (C) Usually, sedation can be controlled by altering opioid dosage, or switching to a drug with a shorter half-life, as well as stopping other sedating medications. If this fails, amphetamine, methylphenidate, and caffeine can be used to counteract the sedative effect. (Devita, p. 3001)# Diseases of the Nervous System Questions

The disease starts typically between ages 35 and 40 (although the variation is wide) and runs its course in about 15 years. The akinetic rigid variety (Westphal variant) of Huntington's typically has a childhood onset. (Ropper, p. 910)
3. (E) Basilar migraine can be very dramatic, and can resemble ischemia in the territory of the basilar posterior cerebral arteries. The visual symptoms of basilar migraine typically affect the whole of both visual fields, and can even cause temporary cortical blindness. There can also be an alarming period of coma or quadriplegia. (Ropper, p. 151)
4. (D) Toxoplasmosis is the most likely diagnosis. The infection has a predilection for the CNS and the eye, and produces encephalitis in utero. Symptoms can be evident in the first few days of life. Infants born with active disease may have fever, rash, seizures, and hepatosplenomegaly at birth. (Ropper, p. 882)
5. (A) Occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery is most likely to cause homonymous hemianopia. This artery conveys blood to the inferior and medial portion of the posterior temporal and occipital lobes and to the optic thalamus. (Ropper, p. 677)
6. (D) This man has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The disease causes neuronal loss in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and motor nuclei of the lower brain stem. The disease is one of constant progression, rather than remissions and exacerbations, and death usually occurs within 5 years. There is no sensory loss and no seizure diathesis, because only the motor system is involved. There can be signs of hyperreflexia and spasticity, depending on the balance of upper and lower motor neuron damage, but not cogwheel rigidity. (Ropper, p. 939)
7. (D) There are disturbances of norepinephrine, glutamic acid decarboxylase, choline acetyltransferase, GABA, acetylcholine, and somatostatin, but their significance is poorly understood. Dopamine blocking agents (e.g., haloperidol) can be used to treat psychosis and ameliorate chorea but do not alter the course of disease. Presynaptic dopamine depletors such as clozapine, reserpine, or tetrabenazine can be used for chorea as well, but have significant side effects. Antidepressants are helpful for symptomatic treatment. Most patients eventually end up in an institution. (Ropper, p. 913)
8. (A) This patient has multiple sclerosis (MS). Weakness or numbness in one or more limbs is the initial manifestation of disease in about halfthe patients. Other common initial presentations include optic neuritis ( $25 \%$ ) and acute myelitis. Hemiplegia, seizures, and cervical myelopathy (in older patients) occur occasionally as the initial manifestation. Sphincter impairment usually occurs later in the disease. (Ropper, p. 777)
9. (A) Posterior circulation TIA is suggested by the transient episodes. The basilar artery is formed by the two vertebral arteries and supplies the pons, the midbrain, and the cerebellum. With vertebrobasilar TIAs, tinnitus, vertigo, diplopia, ataxia, hemiparesis, and bilateral visual impairment are common findings. (Ropper, p. 692)
10. (E) The hemianopia is due to a lesion of the left optic radiations. The posterior cerebral artery arises from the basilar artery but is sometimes a branch of the internal carotid. With posterior cerebral artery lesions affecting the occipital cortex, it is possible for the hemianopia to be an isolated finding. (Ropper, p. 218)
11. (C) The two common forms of neurofibromatosis (NF-1 and NF-2) are genetically distinct. NF-1 is the type with multiple café au lait spots and is associated with axillary or inguinal freckling, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), peripheral neurofibromas, and bony abnormalities (including kyphoscoliosis). NF-2 is associated with CNS tumors, particularly bilateral eighth nerve tumors. Skin lesions are spare or absent, and early lens opacities can occur. (Ropper, p. 869)
12. (B) Huntington's chorea is the most likely diagnosis given the hereditary nature of this patient's illness (autosomal dominants). It differs from Sydenham's chorea by its gradual onset and slow choreic movements versus brusque jerks seen in Sydenham's. The caudate nucleus and putamen are both severely involved in Huntington's chorea, and degeneration of the caudate nucleus results in enlarged lateral ventricles (with a "butterfly" appearance on CT). Atrophy is very widespread in the brain and includes the cerebral cortex. A decrease in glucose metabolism as revealed on positron emission tomography (PET) scan precedes the evidence of tissue loss. (Ropper, p. 911)
13. (B) Prophylactic administration of diazepam in a withdrawing alcoholic can prevent or reduce severe syndromes such as delirium tremens (DTs). Prophylactic phenytoin, however, is not helpful. A calm, quiet environment with close observation and frequent reassurance is very important. Vitamin administration (especially thiamine) is important, but frequently, severe magnesium depletion slows improvement. (Ropper, pp. 1010-1011)
14. (C) Third nerve palsy can result in ptosis of the eyelid. There is also loss of the ability to open the eye, and the eyeball is deviated outward and slightly downward. With complete lesions, the pupil is dilated, does not react to light, and loses the power of accommodation. In diabetes, the pupil is often spared. The sixth cranial nerve can also be affected by diabetes, but this is much less common. (Ropper, p. 1135)
15. (D) This person has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by sudden-onset brief episodes of vertigo lasting less than a minute. The symptoms are usually brought on by head movement. The cause is commonly attributed to calcium debris in the semicircular canals, known as canalithiasis. The debris is loose otoconia (calcium carbonate) within the utricular sac. Although BPPV can occur after head trauma, there is usually no obvious precipitating factor. It generally abates spontaneously and can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation. (Ropper, p. 261)
16. (A) Injury to the ulnar nerve results in impaired adduction and abduction of the fingers. The nerve is commonly injured in elbow dislocations and fractures. The fibers arise from the eighth cervical and the first thoracic segments. The ulnar is a mixed nerve with sensory supply to the medial hand. (Ropper, p. 1168)
17. (D) This woman does not have risk factors for sleep apnea (older age, snoring, obesity) and likely has narcolepsy. Adrenergic stimulant drugs such as methylphenidate or amphetamines help the sleepiness, and tricyclic compounds can help the cataplexy. Strategically planned naps can also be helpful. (Ropper, p. 348)18. (B) The combination of symptoms is typical of chronic alcohol abuse. The mental symptoms are suggestive of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. A distal limb sensory-motor neuropathy is also typical of alcoholism. Confusion, tremulousness, and disorientation are typical for acute alcohol intoxication. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a symptom complex of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, nystagmus, and acute confusional state. (Ropper, p. 984)
19. (D) These signs and symptoms develop in a fairly large percentage of patients with diabetes mellitus. Loss of proprioceptive sensation together with absent reflexes superficially resembles tabes dorsalis. If sensory loss is severe, Charcot's joints can develop. (Ropper, pp. 1134-1135)
20. (A) A subdural hematoma is almost always of venous origin and secondary to a minor or severe injury to the head, but may occur in blood dyscrasias or cachexia in the absence of trauma. Acute subdural hematomas commonly present with a fluctuating level of consciousness and significant cerebral damage. Chronic subdurals may also present with seizures or papilledema. (Ropper, pp. 758-759)
21. (C) An acoustic neuroma is most likely to lead to a palsy of the eighth cranial nerve. Deafness, headache, ataxia, tinnitus, and diplopia are seen, as well as facial paresthesias. Acoustic neuromas represent $5-10 \%$ of all intracranial tumors. They develop from Schwann cells and generally grow very slowly. They may be very large before symptoms develop. (Ropper, p. 572)
22. (D) Visual loss in multiple sclerosis varies from slight blurring to no light perception. Other eye symptoms include diplopia and pain. The classic syndrome of optic or retrobulbar neuritis occurs commonly at some point in the disease, and it is the presenting symptom in $25 \%$ of cases. (Ropper, p. 777)
23. (B) The early age of onset and otherwise good health suggest a diagnosis of narcolepsy, which is usually accompanied by other symptomatology. Hypnagogic hallucinations are almost
always visual. They occur most frequently at the onset of sleep, either during the day or at night. They are generally very vivid. Cataplexy is a brief loss of muscle power without loss of consciousness. The patient is fully aware of what is going on. The paralysis may be complete or partial. Automatic behavior with amnesia is a common manifestation of the narcolepsycataplexy syndromes, occurring in $50 \%$ of cases. Automatic behavior can be confused with complex partial seizures. Paresthesias are not part of narcolepsy syndrome. Snoring, restless sleep, and morning headache suggest sleep apnea. (Ropper, p. 510)
24. (C) In hyperthyroidism, neurologic symptoms include tremors of the hands, exophthalmos, lid lag, stare, and muscle weakness. Muscle weakness of hyperthyroidism affects the pelvic girdle and, to a lesser extent, the shoulder girdle. Reflexes are normal or increased, and sensation is normal. It must be differentiated from myasthenia gravis, which may also accompany thyrotoxicosis. (Ropper, p. 80)
25. (A) This young man has Friedreich's ataxia, associated with a gene defect on chromosome 9. The pathologic changes are found in the spinal cord tracts. Degeneration is seen in the posterior columns, the lateral corticospinal tract, and the spinocerebellar tracts. Ataxia, sensory loss, nystagmus, reflex changes, clubfeet, and kyphoscoliosis are the characteristic findings. The heart is frequently involved, and cardiac disease is a common cause of death. (Ropper, pp. 931-934)
26. (E) In Wilson's disease, there is usually a reduction of the serum ceruloplasmin content. Signs and symptoms of injury to the basal ganglia are accompanied by cirrhosis of the liver. Renal involvement is characterized by persistent aminoaciduria. The most common neurologic finding is tremor. The corneal pigmentation (Kayser-Fleischer ring) is the most important diagnostic finding on physical examination. If it is absent, any neurologic findings cannot be ascribed to Wilson's disease. (Ropper, pp. 830-831)27. (D) This patient has trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant drug) is given in doses varying from 600 to 1200 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day. Phenytoin has also been used. The two drugs can also be used in combination. Operative procedures include alcohol injection of the nerve or ganglion, partial section of the nerve in the middle or posterior fossa, decompression of the root, and medullary tractotomy. Radiofrequency surgery can destroy pain fibers but spare motor fibers. (Ropper, pp. 161-163)
28. (B) In central vertigo, the vertigo can be mild and chronic. In peripheral disease, the symptoms are generally more severe, but finite (although often recurrent). (Ropper, p. 265)
29. (E) In myasthenia gravis, weakness of the facial and levator palpebrae muscles produces a characteristic expressionless face, with drooping of the eyelids. Weakness of the ocular muscles may cause paralysis or weakness of individual muscles, paralysis of conjugate gaze, ophthalmoplegia, or a pattern similar to internuclear ophthalmoplegia. The presence of normal pupillary responses to light and accommodation with weakness of extraocular muscles, levators, and orbicularis oculi is almost completely diagnostic of myasthenia. (Ropper, pp. 1250-1251)
30. (A) Adenomas of the pituitary gland constitute approximately $7 \%$ of intracranial tumors, with the chromophobic type being the most common. With macroadenomas, some degree of pituitary insufficiency is common, and half the patients have headaches. With microadenomas, the other pituitary functions may be completely normal. (Ropper, p. 575)
31. (A) The most common initial symptom of ALS is weakness and wasting of the extremities. The fasciculations can be a very prominent part of the disease. This is rare in other neurologic disorders. (Ropper, p. 939)
32. (C) The characteristic triad in Parkinson's disease (Tremor, Rigidity, Akinesia) has been expanded to include Postural instability. This forms the mnemonic TRAP. Autonomic instability is also common. Findings on examination
also include masklike facies, dysarthria, stooped posture, and abnormal gait. (Ropper, pp. 916-917)
33. (B) Tinnitus and deafness may be found in peripheral vertigo, but not central. The nystagmus is usually unidirectional and is never vertical. Visual fixation inhibits vertigo and nystagmus during testing in peripheral vertigo. (Ropper, p. 260)
34. (A) Adults may develop hydrocephalus as a result of occlusion of CSF pathways by tumors in the third ventricle, brain stem, or posterior fossa. In adults, the symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus include headache, lethargy, malaise, incoordination, and weakness. Seizures do not usually occur. Dementia, altered consciousness, ocular nerve palsies, papilledema, ataxia, or corticospinal tract signs may be present. (Ropper, p. 535)
35. (B, D, F) Myelin is a complex protein lipid carbohydrate structure, which forms part of the cell membrane of the oligodendroglia. Vascular lesions cause demyelination because of ischemia. Papovaviruses can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in patients with HIV infection, or less commonly, malignancy. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis has been described after smallpox or rabies vaccination. Nutritional deficiencies can also cause demyelination (e.g., pernicious anemia with vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency). (Ropper, p. 771)
36. (C) Pontine hemorrhage is associated with impaired oculocephalic reflexes and small, reactive pupils. It generally evolves over a few minutes, usually with coma and quadriplegia. The prognosis is poor, and death often occurs within hours. (Ropper, p. 714)
37. (B) Cerebellar hemorrhage, when mild, may present with only headache, vomiting, and ataxia of gait. Patients may complain of dizziness or vertigo. The eyes may be deviated to the side opposite the hemorrhage. Nystagmus is not common, but an ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy can occur. This is the only type of intracerebral hemorrhage that commonly benefits from surgical intervention. (Ropper, p. 741)38. (H) Hypertensive encephalopathy is an unusual complication of chronic hypertension and, nowadays, is almost never the initial presentation of hypertension. Intracerebral hemorrhage into the cerebellum, pons, and thalamus are usually due to spontaneous rupture of small, penetrating arteries and are also associated with hypertension. The lack of physical findings argues against one of these hemorrhagic processes. Cocainerelated hemorrhage is caused by acute hypertension. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is more likely caused by an aneurysm, and lobar intracerebral hemorrhage is frequently caused by nonhypertensive factors such as amyloid angiopathy, AVMs, and aneurysms. (Ropper, p. 728)
39. (G) AVMs are more frequently seen in men and, although present from birth, do not usually become symptomatic until later in life. The peak incidence of symptoms is between ages 10 and 30. The headaches can be similar to migraine, or it can be more diffuse. It can also present with seizure or rupture. Hemorrhage can be massive or minimal when rupture does occur. (Ropper, p. 723)
40. (D) The most common familial periodic paralysis syndrome is usually associated with low potassium, but there are less common forms characterized by high or normal potassium. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of weakness or paralysis of the somatic musculature, with loss of the deep tendon reflexes. Preventive therapy includes potassium supplementation and possibly a low carbohydrate, low salt, high potassium diet. Imipramine and acetazolamide are said to be useful in acute attacks. (Ropper, p. 1270)
41. (B, E, H) Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disease with a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. Lesions occur in the nervous system, skin, bones, retina, kidney, and elsewhere. The skin lesions include facial nevi (fibroma molluscum) and patches of skin fibrosis. Hard nodules are found throughout the brain. Seizures and mental retardation can occur. (Ropper, pp. 866-867)
42. (C, F) Syringomyelia is characterized by a dissociated sensory loss. Atrophy of the muscles can
result in a clawhand deformity. Fasciculations are commonly found. (Ropper, pp. 1084-1085)
43. (B) The most common presenting symptoms relate to weakness of eye muscles, causing ptosis or diplopia. Difficulty in chewing, dysarthria, and dysphagia are also common. The differential diagnosis includes all diseases that cause weakness of oropharyngeal or limb muscles. These include the muscular dystrophies, ALS, and progressive bulbar palsies, among others. Most other conditions do not improve after injection of edrophonium or neostigmine. (Ropper, pp. 1250-1251)
44. (B) This man had a generalized posttraumatic seizure. The prolonged confusion after the event suggests seizure rather than syncope. In the majority of cases, seizures do not develop until several months after the injury, 6-18 months being the most common interval. The more severe the injury, the greater the likelihood of seizures. For severe injuries, some authorities recommend prophylactic anticonvulsants for $1-2$ years. There is no firm evidence for this, however. (Ropper, p. 291)
45. (C) This patient has herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Acyclovir selectively inhibits viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase. Acyclovir is currently the treatment of choice because of better efficacy and less toxicity than previous drugs. Because it is so nontoxic, therapy can be started even if the diagnosis is only presumptive. (Ropper, p. 639)
46. (C) CT scan is still superior to MRI in certain circumstances, particularly in the emergency setting, for diagnosing acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral bleeding, fractures of the face, temporal bone, and base of the skull. ACT is useful in evaluating patients with osseous spinal stenosis and spondylosis, but an MRI is preferred if there are neurologic defects. (Ropper, p. 16)
47. (B) The lateral medullary syndrome (also known as Wallenberg syndrome) causes ipsilateral numbness but also contralateral involvement of pain and thermal sense by affecting thespinothalamic tract. It can be caused by occlusion of the vertebral arteries; posterior-inferior cerebellar arteries; and superior, middle, or inferior medullary arteries. Ipsilateral ataxia and falling to the side of the lesion are common. Ipsilateral paralysis of the tongue is characteristic of medial medullary syndrome, which also causes contralateral paralysis of arm and leg. Paralysis of the body is not characteristic of lateral medullary syndrome, but ipsilateral paralysis of palate and vocal cord does occur. Ipsilateral Horner syndrome, nystagmus, diplopia, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting are characteristic. (Ropper, pp. 678-679)
48. (C) TSP is frequently associated with a retroviral (HTLV-1) infection that can be spread through blood transfusion, sexual contact, intravenous drug use, and vertical transmission from mother to child. It is slowly progressive, and bladder involvement is characteristic. Sensory symptoms are usually mild, and a true sensory level is almost never found. On occasion, cranial nerve findings, frontal release signs, and cerebellar signs (tremor, dysmetria) are present. (Ropper, pp. 647-648, 1059)
49. (A) The cause of trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) is unknown, although some cases may be caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve by arteries or veins of the posterior fossa. The pain occurs in paroxysms and is strictly limited to one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Paroxysms may be brief or last up to 15 minutes. There is no objective sensory loss, but the patient may complain of hyperesthesia of the face. Watering of the eye on the involved side may occur during an attack. (Ropper, pp. 161-163)
50. (A) Cavernous sinus thrombosis is usually secondary to traumatic, neoplastic, or suppurative processes in the orbit, the nasal sinuses, or the upper half of the face. The optic discs are swollen, and there may be numerous surrounding small or large hemorrhages if the orbital veins are occluded. Visual acuity is normal or moderately impaired. Involvement of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus (third, fourth, sixth, and V1 and V2 divisions of the fifth) causes diplopia, ptosis, and sensory loss on the face. (Ropper, p. 735)
51. (C) In the vast majority of cases, retrobulbar neuritis occurs as an episode in a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis. It is the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis in $15 \%$ of cases and occurs at some point in $50 \%$ of all patients with the disease. The course of the retrobulbar neuritis is that of gradual spontaneous improvement. (Ropper, p. 213)
52. (E) Internal carotid artery insufficiency is the most likely diagnosis. Abnormalities are found in the extracranial arteries in more than one-half of the patients with symptomatic cerebral infarction. Current treatment is carotid endarterectomy for severe stenosis and aspirin therapy for lesser degrees of stenosis. (Ropper, pp. 686-692)
53. (B) The patient's findings strongly suggest herpes simplex encephalitis. This is generally caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSVI). When the disease is suspected, appropriate antiviral therapy (acyclovir) should be started immediately. CT scan is not helpful in diagnosis because it becomes positive only late in the disease, but MRI scans may be helpful. Brain biopsy, once the diagnostic test of choice, is the most definitive test but is rarely performed. (Ropper, pp. 638-639)
54. (C) Guillain-Barré syndrome often appears days to weeks after a viral upper respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) infection. The initial symptoms are due to symmetric limb weakness. Paresthesias may be present. Unlike most other neuropathies, proximal muscles may be affected more than distal muscles early in the disease. Tendon reflexes are usually lost within a few days. Protein content of the CSF is usually high within a few days of onset. (Ropper, pp. 1121-1122)
55. (E) This patient has myasthenia gravis and the thymus tissue is often abnormal, with encapsulated tumors occurring in about $15 \%$ of cases. Almost all thymomas occur in patients over age 30. Even without thymoma, thymectomy can result in remission in patients with generalized myasthenia. Its benefit is delayed for months or more, so it is not an emergency treatment for myasthenia. (Ropper, p. 1252)56. (D) Vertigo is defined as an illusory or hallucinatory feeling of movement of the body or environment, usually spinning. Dizziness can be caused by multiple factors in the elderly, including orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, and depression. (Ropper, p. 257)
57. (C) Patients with BPPV, in contrast to those with central positional vertigo, have a latent period from the time of onset of the offending position to development of symptoms. With maintenance of the position, patients with BPPV become less symptomatic (fatigability), and repeated positioning also lessens the symptoms (habituation). As well, in BPPV, although the symptoms are usually severe, they can be quite variable from one testing period to the next. (Ropper, p. 261)
58. (A) Anticholinergic drugs exacerbate the underlying defects. Cholinergic drugs are largely inhibitors of cholinesterase. Prednisone may improve as many as $80 \%$ of patients. Thymectomy helps patients with no thymoma, but thymoma patients do not do as well. Plasmapheresis benefits most patients but needs to be repeated at intervals. (Ropper, pp. 1256-1258)
59. (E) Myoclonic seizures are sudden, brief, single, or repetitive muscle contractions involving one body part or the entire body. Loss of consciousness does not occur unless other types of seizures coexist. These seizures can be idiopathic or associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, uremia, hepatic failure, subacute leukoencephalopathies, and some hereditary disorders. Recent evidence has linked a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a prion disease of cattle. This variant form usually presents with ataxia and behavior changes prior to myoclonus and dementia. (Ropper, pp. 87-89)
60. (B) Complex partial seizures were once classified as temporal lobe epilepsy. Although the temporal lobe (especially the hippocampus or amygdala) is the most common site of origin,
some seizures have been shown to originate from mesial parasagittal or orbital frontal regions. (Ropper, p. 277)
61. (D) Pure absence seizures consist of the sudden cessation of ongoing conscious activity without convulsive muscular activity or loss of postural control. They can be so brief as to be inapparent but can last several minutes. There is usually no period of postictal confusion. (Ropper, p. 274)
62. (A) Simple partial seizures can occur with motor, sensory, autonomic, or psychic symptoms. When a partial motor seizure spreads to adjacent neurons, a "Jacksonian march" can occur (e.g., right thumb to right hand and right arm to right side of face). Face and hand movements are frequently linked because their cortical controlling regions are adjacent. (Ropper, pp. 275-276)
63. (D) Absence seizures almost always begin in young children (age 6-14). They may first present as learning difficulties in school. The EEG is diagnostic, revealing brief $3-\mathrm{Hz}$ spike and wave discharges occurring synchronously throughout all the leads. (Ropper, p. 274)
64. (E) Valproic acid can be used for typical and atypical seizures, myoclonic seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures. It causes little sedation and does not impair cognition. However, the blood count and liver tests must be monitored for a time after initiation of therapy to ensure the safety of the patient. (Ropper, p. 293)
65. (E) Valproic acid is the drug of choice for atypical absence seizures and myoclonic seizures. (Ropper, p. 293)
66. (A, B, E) Phenytoin is the first choice for tonicclonic seizures; it can cause gum hyperplasia and hirsutism, which are particularly unpleasant side effects in young women. Lymphadenopathy, ataxia, incoordination, confusion, and cerebellar toxicity can also occur. Carbamazepine and valproic acid are also options for the initial treatment of tonic-clonic seizures. (Ropper, p. 293)67. (A, B) Carbamazepine is the initial choice for partial seizures. Phenytoin is also an option. (Ropper, p. 292)
68. (G) Lorazepam or diazepam is the treatment of choice for status epilepticus. Diazepam intravenously (IV) at $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ up to 20 mg , or lorazepam IV $(0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg})$ at no faster than $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, is initially given followed by phenytoin loading ( $15-18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) no faster than $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. (Ropper, p. 297)
69. (B) Horner syndrome results in a small, round pupil on one side. Light and near reaction is brisk, and response to mydriatics and miotics is normal. The affected pupil will not dilate in the dark, so darkness accentuates the anisocoria. The syndrome is often idiopathic but can be caused by neoplasm, brain stem stroke, or carotid dissection. (Ropper, pp. 464-465)
70. (C) The tonic pupil (Holmes-Adie syndrome) is caused by a parasympathetic lesion at or distal to the ciliary ganglion. The pupil is large and usually unilateral, with absent response to light. A bright room, by causing constriction of the normal pupil, accentuates the anisocoria. The tonic pupil can be associated with ShyDrager syndrome, amyloidosis, or diabetes. However, it is most commonly seen in otherwise healthy young women. (Ropper, p. 243)
71. (D) Argyll Robertson pupils are small, irregular, and often bilateral. The response to light is impaired, but the response to near vision is preserved. Argyll Robertson pupils can be a manifestation of syphilis, a treponemal infection. It can also be associated with lesions of the dorsal midbrain (obstructive hydrocephalus, pineal region tumors) and after aberrant regeneration. (Ropper, p. 242)
72. (A) This patient has physiologic or essential anisocoria, which can be seen in up to $20 \%$ of the population at some time. Its hallmarks are a normal response to light and accommodation and the asymmetry is maintained in different lighting conditions. It can also be variable from day to day. (Ropper, p. 243)
73. (G) Compression of the oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve) results in paresis of the oculomotor muscles supplied by the nerve and symptoms of double vision. The parasympathetic fibers running along the outside of the nerve are also affected resulting in dilation of the pupil. Increased intracranial pressure from any mass lesion (blood, abscess, or tumor) leading to uncal herniation and compression of the nerve is the usual cause. (Ropper, p. 230)
74. (B) Peripheral nerve lesions result in reflex loss greater than the degree of weakness. Reflex loss is variable in anterior horn cell disease and decreased proportionately in muscle disease. In neuromuscular junction disorders, reflexes are characteristically normal. (Ropper, pp. 1113-1114)
75. (C) Diurnal fluctuations and pathologic fatigue are common in disorders of neuromuscular transmission (e.g., myasthenia gravis). (Ropper, pp. 1250-1251)
76. (A) In diseases of the anterior horn cell (such as ALS), atrophy is marked and early. Muscle disease can result in marked atrophy, but much later in the course of the disease. Atrophy is generally moderate in peripheral nerve disease and absent in disorders of the neuromuscular junction. (Ropper, p. 939)
77. (B) Peripheral nerve disease is the most likely to cause distal weakness and is the only one of the four to also cause sensory symptoms. (Ropper, p. 1168)
78. (D) Dermatomyositis is one of the inflammatory myopathies that has a characteristic rash on the eyelids (heliotrope) and knuckles (Gottron's papules). It is associated with certain cancers as a paraneoplastic syndrome. The muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CK) is elevated is most cases, but the condition is painless. Symptoms are those of proximal muscle weakness, with normal reflexes and tone on examination. (Ropper, pp. 1204-1205)This page intentionally left blank# Kidneys <br> Questions

She is admitted to the intensive care unit for management of sepsis and hypotension. On the second hospital day, she still has a low urine output, despite a normal blood pressure and heart rate. Her urea and creatinine have doubled since admission. (SELECT THREE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (D) Urea is filtered at the glomerulus, and thereafter, any movement in or out of tubules is a passive process depending on gradients, not secretion. Reabsorption of urea in the distal tubule and collecting duct, when urine flow is reduced, results in the disproportionate elevation of urea nitrogen over creatinine in prerenal azotemia. (Kasper, p. 246)
2. (D) Renal scans initially show a reduction in excretion with cortical retention. This is the most common type of rejection. Most acute rejections will respond to immunosuppressive agents if diagnosed early. In contrast, immediate nonfunction of a graft can be caused by damage to the kidney during procurement and storage. Such problems are becoming less frequent. Obstruction, vascular compression, and ureteral compression are other causes of primary nonfunction of a renal graft. (Kasper, p. 1672)
3. (D) Both granular and erythrocyte casts are present, but the latter indicate bleeding from the glomerulus and are most characteristically seen. Red cells reach the urine probably via capillary wall "gaps" and form casts as they become embedded in concentrated tubular fluid with high protein content. Proteinuria is invariably present but is not as specific. (Kasper, pp. 250-251)
4. (E) These humps are discrete, electron-dense nodules that persist for about 8 weeks and are highly characteristic of the disease. Light microscopy reveals diffuse proliferation, and immunofluorescence reveals granular immunoglobulin G (IgG) and C3. Most patients will recover spontaneously. (Kasper, pp. 1680-1681)
5. (A) The urine contains large amounts of potassium, magnesium, and sodium. The large volume is often appropriate for preexisting volume expansion, but careful attention to fluid and electrolytes is important to prevent hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, and volume depletion. (Kasper, p. 1724)
6. (B) She has analgesic nephropathy, and chronic analgesic ingestion may lead to papillary necrosis and tubulointerstitial inflammation. Complete understanding of the pathogenesis is lacking, and may vary with different analgesics. Depletion of reducing equivalents such as glutathione may also play a role. (Kasper, p. 1703)
7. (D) Although all drugs should be reassessed at this time, and if appropriate, the dosage adjusted, drugs with known nephrotoxicity, such as ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs, should be stopped. (Kasper, p. 1644)
8. (A) Diuretics are a common cause for metabolic alkalosis since many patients take these medications for hypertension or CHF. Diarrhea causes a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, and mineralocorticoid excess leads to metabolic alkalosis, primarily because of renal bicarbonate generation. Other major mechanisms for metabolic alkalosis include extracellular fluid (ECF) volume contraction, potassium depletion, and increased distal salt delivery. Less common causes are Liddle syndrome, bicarbonate loading (posthypercapnic alkalosis), and delayed conversion of administered organic acids. (Kasper, pp. 265, 267-268)9. (C) In sickle cell anemia, the kidney is characterized by an inability to concentrate the urine because of functional tubule defects that occur as a result of ischemic injury. Papillary necrosis may also occur in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait during a sickle crisis. Some patients can develop glomerular injury (focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis) after many years from the anemia-induced hyperfiltration that occurs. (Kasper, pp. 1709-1710)
10. (E) The typical renal lesions in gout are urate crystals in the medulla or pyramids, with surrounding mononuclear and giant cell reaction. The degree of renal impairment, however, does not correlate with hyperuricemia, and the decline in renal function correlates with aging, hypertension, renal calculi, or unrelated nephropathy. (Kasper, p. 1704)
11. (E) The danger of ARF after IVP has led to caution, especially in patients with multiple myeloma. The patient should not be dehydrated if IVP is necessary. The risk is also increased in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal failure. (Kasper, pp. 1646-1647)
12. (A) Renal amyloidosis can be primary (AL) or secondary amyloidosis (AA). The hallmark finding, nephrotic syndrome, is present in $25 \%$ of patients at presentation and probably develops ultimately in over $50 \%$. The apple-green birefringence deposits under polarized light are diagnostic of amyloidosis, and not seen in any other renal disease. (Kasper, p. 1689)
13. (B) In multiple myeloma, tubular damage by light chains is almost always present. The injury is a direct toxic effect of the light chains or indirectly from the inflammatory response. Infiltration by plasma cells and glomerular injury is rare. Hypercalcemia may produce transient or irreversible renal damage as do amyloid and myeloma cell infiltrates. (Kasper, p. 658)
14. (B) The urine osmolality in patients with SIADH need not be hypertonic to plasma, but only inappropriately high compared with
serum. The major characteristics of SIADH include hyponatremia, volume expansion without edema, natriuresis, hypouricemia, and normal or reduced serum creatinine level, with normal thyroid and adrenal function. (Kasper, pp. 2102-2103)
15. (C) Although an elevated PSA ( $>4$ ) has the best positive predictive value, combining it with DRE is probably the most effective screening process. (Kasper, p. 545)
16. (B) It is very likely that control of hypertension and excellent glucose control will slow the development and course of renal disease in Type II diabetes mellitus. ACE inhibitors seem to decrease proteinuria and slow progression of renal disease. As renal function deteriorates, limiting dietary protein intake can also be beneficial. Calcium channel blockers have no extra effect beyond their antihypertensive effect. (Kasper, pp. 2164-2165)
17. (C) Persistent proteinuria should always be investigated and, if no cause can be found, yearly follow-up instituted. Mild proteinuria has significant prognostic value in diabetes. Mild proteinuria can be caused by glomerular or tubular causes. Functional causes of proteinuria such as fever, orthostasis, exercise, and heart failure are usually reversible. (Kasper, p. 250)
18. (C) Renal vein thrombosis is associated with heavy proteinuria and hematuria. Flank pain and pulmonary embolism can also occur. (Kasper, p. 1707)
19. (A) This patient likely has hypernephroma (renal cell carcinoma). Polycythemia is caused by the production of erythropoietin-like factors. There is no relationship to hypertension. The tumor frequently presents as metastatic disease. (Kasper, pp. 541-542)
20. (C) Hypokalemia can result in paralytic ileus, rhabdomyolysis, weakness, and cardiac repolarization abnormalities. It is a common complication along with hyponatremia of starting patients on diuretics. (Kasper, p. 260)21. (E) Intrathoracic lesions may be benign or malignant, and the latter may secrete a substance similar to vasopressin. Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common intrathoracic lesion causing SIADH. (Kasper, pp. 2102-2103)
22. (B) The largest volume of water is reabsorbed in the nephron at the proximal convolution. Maximally concentrated urine depends on ADH , which allows distal convoluted tubes and collecting ducts to become permeable to water. (Kasper, pp. 1640-1641)
23. (A) The diagnosis is renal cell carcinoma. There is marked hypervascularity of the left kidney. The arteries are irregular and tortuous, following a random distribution. There are small vessels within the renal vein that indicate the blood supply of the neoplastic thrombosis involving the renal vein. The kidney is enlarged and abnormally bulbous in the lower pole. CT scans have dramatically decreased the need for arteriography in evaluating renal lesions. (Kasper, pp. 541-542)
24. (A) Renal ultrasound is an important test in the assessment of acute and chronic renal failure. The oliguria suggests that obstruction is a possible explanation for the renal failure. Imaging is very sensitive for obstruction, but if bladder obstruction secondary to a large prostate is suspected, bladder catheterization would be the first step. (Kasper, p. 248)
25. (C) Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are increased in diabetes mellitus as well as in pregnancy, sickle cell disease, polycystic disease, and structural abnormalities of the urinary tract. (Kasper, p. 2169)
26. (A) Numerous diseases are associated with renal and pulmonary manifestations, including lupus, Goodpasture's syndrome, and Wegener's granulomatosis. Wegener's is typically associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. (Kasper, p. 2005)
27. (E) In addition to amyloid disease, other conditions associated with nephrotic syndrome are
secondary syphilis, malaria, and treatment with gold salts. Minimal change nephrotic syndrome, focal glomerular sclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative GN are the primary renal diseases that present as nephrotic syndrome. (Kasper, p. 1689)
28. (C) ATN is a common complication of prolonged hypotension and ischemic injury to the renal tubules. Heme-granular "muddy brown" casts are consistent with ATN. Peritoneal dialysis is preferred with cerebral trauma as well as with severe heart failure because of risk of hemorrhage or hypotension with hemodialysis. In particular, peritoneal dialysis does not require any anticoagulation and is safer if head trauma has occurred. (Kasper, pp. 1645-1646)
29. (E) Diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, multifetal gestation, and prior preeclampsia are associated with preeclampsia. When toxemia occurs in the first trimester, however, hydatidiform mole must be considered. The clinical manifestations of severe preeclampsia include headache, epigastric pain, visual disturbances, and hypertension. HIV is not associated with preeclampsia unless there is a preexisting renal disease. (Kasper, p. 32)
30. (D) RA is not associated with polycystic kidney disease. It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and about $50 \%$ develop renal failure by age 60 years. Cysts are also seen in the liver (more common) and pancreas. Also 5-10\% of asymptomatic patients can have cerebral aneurysms. Renal transplantation is utilized in end-stage renal failure (ESRF). The transplanted kidney cannot be affected by the disease. (Kasper, pp. 1694-1696)
31. (A) Cystinuria is a congenital disorder associated with decreased tubular resorption of cystine, arginine, ornithine, and lysine. Only cystine is insoluble and is the cause of renal calculi. The typical hexagonal crystals are most likely to be seen on an acidic early-morning urine specimen. A positive cyanide-nitroprusside screening test should be confirmed by chromatography. (Kasper, p. 1714)32. (A) Increase in neoplasms in renal transplant recipients includes cervical carcinoma, lymphoma, and cutaneous malignancies. Osteoporosis and persistent hyperparathyroidism are other bony complications. Risk of infection is related to degree of immunosuppression. Nevertheless, the most common causes of death are cardiovascular and tend to occur earlier than in the general population. (Kasper, p. 1673)
33. (C) Amikacin and vancomycin are the other antibiotics that require dose reduction in renal failure. Newer antibiotics are often used instead of aminoglycosides to reduce the risk of renal damage. (Kasper, p. 795)
34. (D) Red cell casts are not seen in diabetic nephropathy and suggest another acute GN process. Nephrotic range proteinuria, type IV RTA (hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism), hypertension, and microalbuminuria are all complications of diabetic kidney disease. (Kasper, pp. 2164-2165)
35. (B) Isolated hematuria is usually of urologic cause (e.g., tumor, trauma, stone) but can also can be glomerular in origin. The finding of red cell casts or dysmorphic red cells (best appreciated by phase microscopy) suggests the source of bleeding is glomerular in origin. (Kasper, pp. 250-251)
36. (A) Although evidence of volume contraction cannot confirm prerenal ARF, as this can progress into intrinsic renal failure, it suggests that prerenal factors are contributing. In prerenal ARF, specific gravity is usually $>1.020$ and sodium concentration is $<10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$. The fractional excretion of sodium relates sodium clearance to creatinine clearance and is more sensitive than direct measurements of sodium excretion. In prerenal azotemia, sodium is avidly resorbed from glomerular filtrate, but not in intrinsic renal azotemia because of tubular epithelial cell injury. Creatinine is resorbed less efficiently in both conditions. Therefore, the fractional excretion of sodium is $<1 \%$ in prerenal azotemia (often much less) whereas it
is $>1 \%$ in intrinsic renal azotemia. Fractional excretion of sodium $(\%)=\mathrm{UNa} / \mathrm{PCr} \times$ $\mathrm{PNa} / \mathrm{UCr} \times 100$. (Kasper, pp. 247-248)
37. (E) The ratio of BUN/creatinine is usually $<10-15$ in intrinsic renal disease and $>20$ in prerenal azotemia. (Kasper, p. 248)
38. (A, D) Gestational diabetes can result in hyperglycemia and polyuria with subsequent polydipsia (osmotic diuresis). A primary deficiency in vasopressin can result from increased metabolism by a placental enzyme and result in central DI (called gestational DI). It resolves within a few weeks after delivery. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
39. (A) Head injury can result in central DI from injury to the pituitary or hypothalamus. This can develop abruptly or gradually. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
40. (B) Nephrogenic DI can be inherited on the $X$ chromosome. Its $X$-linked recessive nature means that males are predominantly affected. Only women who are homozygous are affected. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
41. (B) Lithium is one of the drugs that cause nephrogenic DI. Hypercalcemia and hypokalemia can also cause the syndrome. (Kasper, pp. 2098-2099)
42. (A) She has a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis because of bicarbonate loss from the diarrhea. The anion gap is calculated as the sodium concentration minus the chloride plus the bicarbonate concentration. Other causes of bicarbonate loss with normal anion gap include proximal RTA and primary hyperparathyroidism. (Kasper, p. 267)
43. (C) Causes of acute respiratory acidosis include narcotic overdose, myasthenia gravis, airway obstruction, and trauma to the chest. Acute increases in $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ result in carbon dioxide narcosis. This starts with somnolence and confusion and can lead to coma. Asterixis may be present. Cerebral vasodilation may result in frank papilledema. (Kasper, p. 269)44. (B) Diuretics are a common cause of metabolic alkalosis. The disorder can occur in volume expanded patients in whom the alkalosis is unresponsive to sodium chloride loading, as in primary hyperaldosteronism or volume contraction with secondary hyperaldosteronism, as in this case. (Kasper, p. 268)
45. (A) INH can result in impaired oxygen utilization, leading to lactic acidosis (type B), accumulation of lactate, and increased anion gap. (Kasper, p. 266)
46. (D) Chronic salicylate use can cause respiratory alkalosis. Severe salicylate toxicity results in an anion gap metabolic acidosis such as during an overdose. During acute hyperventilation, plasma bicarbonate concentrations fall by approximately $3 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ when the arterial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ falls to about 25 mm Hg . Acute respiratory alkalosis can be caused by anxiety, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, drugs, or fever. Chronic respiratory alkalosis occurs in pregnancy and liver disease as well. (Kasper, p. 270)
47. (E) The diuretic phase of ATN is characterized by large losses of sodium and water. (Kasper, p. 251)
48. (C) Primary polydipsia can cause greater medullary washout than either nephrogenic or central DI because primary polydipsia tends to cause expansion of the ECF volume. This tends to increase total delivery of sodium chloride and water to the inner medulla. It also increases renal blood flow, and increased flow through the vasa recta reduces ability to trap solutes in the medulla. (Kasper, p. 2098)
49. (A) Nephrogenic DI can be caused by hypokalemia as well as hypercalcemia. (Kasper, p. 2099)
50. (C) Both thioridazine and chlorpromazine have been associated with primary polydipsia. (Kasper, p. 251)
51. (A) There is little or no response to vasopressin after fluid deprivation in complete nephrogenic DI. Incomplete nephrogenic DI will show some response. (Kasper, p. 2099)
52. (D) High protein tube feeds may cause a solute diuresis because of excessive excretion of urea. Other causes of solute diuresis include glucosuria, mannitol, radiographic contrast media, and chronic renal failure. (Kasper, p. 251)
53. (H) The combination of ECF volume contraction with high urinary sodium ( $20 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ suggests renal fluid loss. This is commonly caused by diuretics or glucosuria. (Kasper, pp. 254-256)
54. (C) SIADH is associated with many CNS diseases including meningitis, encephalitis, tumors, trauma, stroke, and acute porphyria. It is assumed that antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in these patients is secreted in response to direct stimulation of the hypothalamic osmoreceptors. (Kasper, pp. 254-256)
55. (C) Amitriptyline is one of the psychoactive drugs that cause SIADH. Others include phenothiazines, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Antineoplastic drugs such as vincristine and cyclophosphamide also cause SIADH, as does the hypoglycemic agent chlorpropamide. (Kasper, p. 2099)
56. (B) The combination of ECF volume contraction and low urinary sodium ( $<10 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L})$ suggests extrarenal sodium loss. Common causes are vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating. (Kasper, pp. 254-256)
57. (A) Hyponatremia associated with nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, or CHF is characterized by edema. It is believed that the hyponatremia is caused by a decrease in "effective" circulating volume secondary to decreased cardiac output or sequestration of fluid. (Kasper, pp. 254-256)
58. (J) This man has osmotic diuresis and associated hyponatremia. The clue to the extra osmoles in the serum is the increased serum osmolality in the setting of hyponatremia. This situation is frequently seen in Type II diabetes. (Kasper, pp. 254-256)59. (B) In patients who have prior diuretic use, resulting in hypokalemia at the time of evaluation, the bicarbonate tends to be elevated and the urine potassium low ( $<25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ). (Kasper, pp. 258-260)
60. (G) Glucocorticoid and licorice ingestion can result in hypertension with low plasma renin and aldosterone levels. (Kasper, pp. 258-260)
61. (C) RTA types I and II cause hypokalemia with high potassium excretion ( $>25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and a low bicarbonate in the absence of hypertension. Diabetic ketoacidosis can also result in this constellation of findings. (Kasper, pp. 258-260)
62. (F) Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by hypertension with high plasma aldosterone and low plasma renin. (Kasper, pp. 258-260)
63. (A) In lower GI loss (diarrhea), the blood pressure is normal, the urine potassium is low ( $<25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), and the bicarbonate is either normal or low. (Kasper, pp. 258-260)
64. (B) Metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis are seen in salicylate overdose. (Kasper, p. 265, 270)
65. (B) Sepsis can cause cardiovascular insufficiency with lactic acidosis, whereas fever and endotoxemia stimulate the respiratory center, causing respiratory alkalosis. (Kasper, pp. 265, 270)
66. (C) Chronic pulmonary disease often causes respiratory acidosis, whereas the steroids frequently used in therapy may cause a metabolic alkalosis. (Kasper, pp. 268, 269)
67. (E) Renal failure causes metabolic acidosis, whereas the loss of $\mathrm{H}+$ ions in vomiting causes a metabolic alkalosis. (Kasper, pp. 265, 268)
68. (B) Hepatic cirrhosis frequently results in chronic respiratory alkalosis. ARF with metabolic acidosis is common in patients with cirrhosis. (Kasper, pp. 265, 270)
69. (A) This is a case of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). Diffuse proliferative GN is characterized by acute nephritic syndrome: ARF over days to weeks, with hypertension, edema, oliguria, and active urine sediment. Less severe clinical presentation correlates with a more benign biopsy. The pattern of glomerular involvement is similar to IgA nephropathy. (Kasper, p. 2010)
70. (A, C, D, G) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can cause a wide variety of renal disorders, and can progress to ESRF. It is difficult to diagnose the type of glomerular involvement in SLE without a biopsy. (Kasper, pp. 1961, 1963)
71. (G) Gold is one of the drugs causing nephrotic syndrome secondary to membranous GN. Captopril and penicillamine have also been implicated. Signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome (low albumin, edema, hyperlipidemia) are common, and membranous GN is also associated with a thrombotic diathesis. (Kasper, p. 1687)
72. (I) This presentation is typical for an inherited disorder of basement membranes such as Alport's syndrome. It is inherited as an X-linked dominant disorder. It is relatively benign in women but frequently progresses to ESRF in men. It is often associated with sensorineural hearing loss. (Kasper, p. 1691)
73. (E) Rifampin can cause minimal change disease as well as more severe renal damage. The described case is typical for minimal change GN with nephrotic syndrome. Drug-induced minimal change GN frequently has an associated interstitial nephritis. INH is not usually associated with renal disease. (Kasper, p. 1685)
74. (G, H, I, K) Rickets and osteomalacia can be secondary to a variety of renal tubular defects. There are also two variants of vitamin D-dependent rickets caused by renal tubular defects. In one variant, there is impaired production of $1,25(\mathrm{OH}) 2 \mathrm{D} 3$, and in the other, there is renal resistance to the action of the hormone. (Kasper, pp. 1698-1701)75. (A) The autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease is often associated with hepatic cysts, intracranial aneurysms, and colonic diverticula. The occurrence of renal failure is usually in the third decade or later. Complications include infection, obstruction by stone or clot, and gross hematuria. (Kasper, p. 1696)
76. (D, E) Bartter syndrome and Liddle syndrome can be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Patients with Liddle syndrome have hypertension, whereas those with Bartter syndrome do not. In both syndromes, hypokalemia is prominent. (Kasper, pp. 1697-1698)
77. (J) Many of the listed disorders can cause nephrolithiasis, but cystinuria is the most common cause of stones in childhood. It is a common inborn error of amino acid transport
and is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The disorder affects transport of all dibasic amino acids (lysine, arginine, ornithine, and cystine) in the kidney and the gut, but symptoms arise from the overexcretion of cystine because it is the least soluble. (Kasper, p. 1714)
78. (A, C) In prerenal ARF (i.e., no histologic damage), the urinalysis reveals only hyaline casts. The urinary osmolality is high ( $>500$ ), and the urine sodium is low ( $<20$ ). The fractional excretion of sodium is $<1$. (Kasper, p. 1644)
79. (B, D, F) In renal failure from ATN, the urinalysis can reveal heme-granular casts, and tubular cells. The fractional excretion of sodium is $>1$, and the urinary sodium is generally $>40$. (Kasper, pp. 1647-1649)# CHAPTER 9

60. A 39-year-old man has had several weeks of fever, abdominal pain, weight loss, and lack of energy. Three days prior to assessment, he developed a left foot drop. Physical examination confirms left peroneal nerve damage and a bilateral sensory peripheral neuropathy in both legs. Laboratory evaluation reveals ESR of $105 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$, WBC of $14,000 / \mathrm{mL}$, and a negative serologic test for ANCA. The eosinophil count is normal. Which of the following is a reasonable method of establishing a diagnosis?
(A) testicular biopsy
(B) skin biopsy
(C) spiral computerized tomography (CT) of chest
(D) further serologic testing
(E) abdominal angiography
61. A 32-year-old woman complains of having intermittent arthralgias of multiple joints and occasional swelling in both knees. The symptoms started about 6 months ago and usually last for weeks at a time and then improve spontaneously. She reports no morning stiffness or any constitutional symptoms. About 1 year ago, she recalls having a round, red, pruritic skin lesion along her belt line, which resolved on its own. Serologic tests confirm a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. Which of the following mechanisms is the most likely cause of this syndrome?
(A) autoimmune
(B) viral infection
(C) spirochetal infection
(D) circulating immune complexes
(E) metabolic (abnormal crystal metabolism)
62. A 74-year-old man presents with a history of increasing frequency of headaches, fatigue, and weight loss for 3 months. He has had migraine headaches in the past, but these are differentfrom them.

84. A 48-year-old man presents with 3 weeks of fever, fatigue, and shortness of breath. He has a history of "nasal allergies" and asthma, which have been poorly controlled in the past month. Two days prior to presentation, he developed weakness in his left foot and it now "drags" when he walks. On examination, his blood pressure is $165 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, pulse $100 / \mathrm{min}$, respirations $20 / \mathrm{min}$, and lungs have bilateral expiratory wheezes. There is left foot drop, and the rest of the neurologic examination is normal. Laboratory evaluation reveals ESR of $90 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$, WBC of $14,000 / \mathrm{mL}$ with $10 \%$ eosinophils, and $1+$ proteinuria. A CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. (SELECT ONE)85. A 39-year-old man has had several weeks of fever, weight loss, and lack of energy. Three days prior to the assessment, he developed a left foot drop. Physical examination confirms left peroneal nerve damage and a bilateral sensory peripheral neuropathy in both legs. Laboratory evaluation reveals ESR of $105 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$, neutrophilia of 14,000 , and a negative serologic test for ANCA. Eosinophil count is normal. Angiography reveals small aneurysms of the celiac and renal arteries. (SELECT ONE)
86. A 40-year old man complains of cough, shortness of breath, and nasal ulcers. He was previously well until 1 month ago. He noticed some blood in his sputum on the day of presentation. On examination, his blood pressure is $170 / 90 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg , pulse $90 / \mathrm{min}$, respirations $22 / \mathrm{min}$, and there are bilateral inspiratory crackles. The oral cavity is normal, but there is a $1-\mathrm{cm}$ nasal septal ulcer. Investigations reveal a positive c-ANCA, $3+$ proteinuria with red cell casts, and pulmonary infiltrates on the CXR. His ESR is $110 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{h}$ and WBC $12,000 / \mathrm{mL}$ with normal eosinophils. (SELECT ONE)
87. A 24-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain, joint discomfort, and lower limb rash. She was well until 1 week before presentation. On examination, she has a palpable purpuric rash on her legs, nonspecific abdominal discomfort, and no active joints. She has 3+ proteinuria, normal WBC, no eosinophils, and elevated creatinine of $1.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Biopsy of the rash confirms vasculitis with immunoglobulin A (IgA) and C3 (complement 3) deposition on immunofluorescence. (SELECT ONE)
88. A 34-year-old man has recurrent painful oral and genital ulcers. Recently, he has noticed multiple painful joints and a decrease in his vision. Last year he had deep vein thrombosis that required treatment. On examination, he has multiple small shallow oral ulcers and similar lesions on his scrotum. The left eye is red and tearing, while his left wrist and right knee are warm and inflamed. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, and ANCA are all normal. His ESR and C-reactive protein are elevated. (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (E) Each syndrome in the lysosomal storage diseases is caused by a mutation-produced deficiency in the activity of a lysosomal enzyme. For example, Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a deficiency of hexosaminidase A, resulting in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Gaucher's disease is caused by a deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase, resulting in an accumulation of glucosylceramide. It has several forms and, as in this case, is most common in Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jews. Type I Gaucher's disease, as described in this case, is the most common type. Severe bone disease and hepatosplenomegaly is characteristic. Lipid-laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) are found in the bone marrow. (Kasper, p. 2317)
2. (C) Anti-Sm detects a protein complexed to six species of small nuclear ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is believed to be very specific for SLE. However, only $30 \%$ of patients have a positive test. In the case presented, there are enough clinical criteria (four) to confirm the diagnosis of SLE with $98 \%$ specificity and $97 \%$ sensitivity. (Kasper, p. 1964)
3. (D) Still's disease (juvenile RA) in an adult may present as fever of unknown origin. Unfortunately, RF is often negative, and a response to NSAIDs along with exclusion of other diseases confirms the diagnosis. (Kasper, p. 109)
4. (B) The sicca syndrome is a recognized feature of Sjögren's syndrome. It can be primary or secondary to other autoimmune disorders such as RA, SLE, scleroderma, or vasculitis. Primary Sjögren's syndrome is most common in
middle-aged women; sicca symptoms can also occur as a complication of HIV infection or in sarcoidosis. Sjögren's syndrome is more likely to have positive serology, while the serology in sarcoid or HIV is negative. Both HIV and Sjögren can have lymphocytic infiltration, but in HIV it is predominantly by $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$lymphocytes, whereas in Sjögren's syndrome, the infiltration is by $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$lymphocytes. In sarcoidosis, biopsy reveals granulomas. (Kasper, p. 1991)
5. (D) ANA is the most important diagnostic autoantibodies in patients being evaluated for SLE. It is rare to have ANA negative SLE. The other antibodies can occur in SLE but not as sensitive for the diagnosis as ANA. AntidsDNA and anti-SM are specific for SLE but not sensitive. (Kasper, p. 1964)
6. (A) This patient has scleroderma and esophageal symptoms are present in more than $50 \%$ of patients. They are due to the reduced tone of the gastroesophageal sphincter and dilation of the distal esophagus. Gastric and small intestinal motility problems can also occur. Vascular ectasia in the GI tract can result in bleeding. (Kasper, p. 1984)
7. (D) The response of pain, stiffness, and headaches to $40-60 \mathrm{mg}$ of prednisone is dramatic in giant cell arteritis. The duration of treatment is not known but most patients require treatment for more than 2 years. ESR is used to monitor response to therapy. Patients need treatment and evaluation for the complications of long-term steroid use such as osteoporosis and diabetes. (Kasper, p. 2009)8. (B) It is most likely that the primary change in osteoarthritis occurs in the cartilage. It is possible that there is a disruption of the collagen network of the cartilage, specifically a disruption of the "glue" holding together adjacent fibers. (Kasper, pp. 2038-2039)
9. (E) Raynaud's phenomenon may lead to gangrene of the fingers. It can be primary (Raynaud's disease) or secondary to other diseases, especially scleroderma, in which it can be the presenting symptom. In women, the primary form is common (over 50\%), and the phenomenon is generally much more frequent in women. Digital infarction is much more common in relationship to scleroderma than it is in primary Raynaud's disease. (Kasper, p. 1983)
10. (A) Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate crystals-CPPD) is distinguishable from gout by positive birefringent crystals. CPPD are short, blunt rhomboids, and urate crystals (seen in gout) are needle-shaped with negative birefringence. (Kasper, p. 2046)
11. (C) The triad of chronic RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia is called Felty's syndrome. It is associated with high titers of RF and extraarticular disease. The increased susceptibility to infections is secondary to both decreased neutrophil number and function. Felty's syndrome is rare in African Americans. (Kasper, p. 1972)
12. (D) Osteophytes can cause pain by stretching periosteal nerve endings. Synovial inflammation is frequently seen in osteoarthritis, but not in ligament inflammation. Microfractures, but not macrofractures, commonly cause pain. Muscle spasm can be an important factor in the joint pain. (Kasper, p. 2038)
13. (B) The child most likely has Henoch-Schönlein purpura, an immune complex vasculitis affecting the skin, GI tract, and renal glomeruli. Inciting antigens include upper respiratory tract infections, drugs, foods, and insect bites. (Kasper, p. 2010)
14. (C) This patient has PMR. Proximal arm and hip muscle/joint discomfort is the hallmark of this disorder. Difficulty in getting out of bed or rising from a chair may suggest polymyositis, but the muscles are normal when muscle strength is assessed. In general, PMR causes painful muscles, not weak muscles. However, pain may lead to profound disuse atrophy and apparent muscle weakness. In these cases, normal CK and nonspecific muscle biopsy still allow accurate differentiation from polymyositis. (Kasper, p. 2009)
15. (C) This man has dermatomyositis, a paraneoplastic phenomenon of many cancers. The most common tumors associated with DM have been bronchogenic carcinomas, ovarian cancers, breast cancers, and melanoma but many others have occurred. The malignancy may antedate or postdate the myositis. Older age makes malignancy more likely. The extent of the workup for malignancy, if DM is the presentation, depends on clinical circumstances, but history and physical examination, not x-rays, are the cornerstones of evaluation. (Kasper, p. 2540)
16. (A) All NSAIDs are probably equally effective in the treatment of this man's ankylosing spondylitis. Options include indomethacin or naproxen, but not phenylbutazone since it can cause aplastic anemia. Exercise and maintaining proper posture are very important. (Kasper, pp. 1995-1996)
17. (A) High pressure in the legs and low pressure in the arms characterize Takayasu's syndrome. Clinical manifestations include easy fatigability of the arms and atrophy of the soft tissues of the face. The course is variable, and spontaneous remissions can occur. The disease predominantly affects young women. (Kasper, pp. 2009-2010)
18. (C) This is a rarefied area involving the frontal and parietal bones, and it is an early stage of Paget's disease in which calvarial thickening and foci or radiopacity are not present within the radiolucent area. At this stage of the disease, a cross-section through the margin of the lesion reveals a compact inner and outer tablein the normal portion, whereas the diploe widens and extends to the outer and inner surfaces of the calvarium without a change in the calvarial thickness in the lesion. (Kasper, p. 2279)
19. (C) About $95 \%$ of patients will develop musculoskeletal symptoms during the course of SLE. Arthralgias and myalgias predominate, but arthritis, hand deformities, myopathy, and avascular necrosis of bone also occur. About $85 \%$ of patients will have hematologic disease and $80 \%$ will have skin manifestations. (Kasper, p. 1962)
20. (D) This patient has RA and aspirin or other nonsteroidal agents are effective medications for relieving the signs and symptoms of disease. They do little to modify the course of the disease, however. The new generation of NSAIDs that are more specific inhibitors of cyclooxygenase 2 cause less GI toxicity. Glucocorticoids are very powerful at suppressing signs and symptoms of disease and may alter disease progression. Methotrexate is an important disease modifying drug (DMRD) used to prevent joint destruction. Gold and antimalarials were important DMRDs in the past before the use of methotrexate and newer "biological" agents. (Kasper, p. 1974)
21. (D) This patient has polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and in classic PAN, unlike microscopic polyangiitis, both small and medium vessels are involved. The renal lesions are ischemic secondary to fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels. In microscopic polyangiitis, a diffuse glomerulonephritis is frequently present. The most common organ systems involved are the kidneys, musculoskeletal system, and peripheral nervous system. (Kasper, p. 2008)
22. (C) The major musculoskeletal issue is progressive scoliosis, which is usually treated with physiotherapy and mechanical bracing. Only severe scoliosis is treated with surgery. Vigorous exercise and pregnancy are felt by some experts to increase the rate of aortic root dilatation. (Kasper, p. 2330)
23. (C) The frequency of aortic insufficiency has been about $4 \%$ in ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

Other cardiac valve anomalies are not increased in incidence. Rarely, congestive heart failure or third degree heart block can occur as well. (Kasper, p. 1994)
24. (A) Hydralazine can cause drug-induced lupus (defined by positive ANA and antihistone antibodies). About $25-30 \%$ of patients treated chronically with hydralazine will develop ANA positivity and about $10-20 \%$ of patients with ANA positivity will develop systemic symptoms compatible with lupus, particularly arthralgias. Genetic variation in drug acetylation rates might be a predisposing factor. (Kasper, p. 1967)
25. (B) This man has a noninflammatory effusion likely from the trauma caused by the fall. In the noninflammatory category, the fluid is transparent, WBC 200-2000/mL ( $<25 \%$ PMNs), glucose is normal, and LDH is low. Another cause for a noninflammatory effusion is osteoarthritis. (Kasper, p. 2032)
26. (C) This woman has an inflammatory category of effusion in view of the opaque color, high WBC 2000-10,000 ( $>50 \%$ PMNs), low glucose, and high LDH. Common causes for this include crystal induced arthritis, SLE, and RA. In septic arthritis, WBC is usually $50,000 / \mathrm{mL}$ or more and often $>100,000 / \mathrm{mL}$ with $>75 \%$ PMNs. Other important tests on synovial fluid include Gram stain and culture when an inflammatory effusion is suspected clinically. (Kasper, p. 2032)
27. (D) Renal disease is usually secondary to deposition of circulating immune complex. Although most patients with SLE have such deposits, only half have clinical nephritis as defined by proteinuria. Renal biopsy can provide both prognostic and therapeutic information. (Kasper, p. 1963)
28. (A) This patient has features of rheumatoid arthritis, and early in RA there may not be any bony changes seen, except nonspecific findings of soft tissue swelling and joint effusions. With longer active inflammation of the joints, loss of cartilage and bony erosions can be seen. The value of x-rays is to determine the extent of bone and cartilage damage. (Kasper, p. 1973)29. (B) Acute anterior uveitis is the most common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Pain, photophobia, and increased lacrimation are the usual symptoms. Attacks are unilateral and tend to recur, often in the other eye. Cataracts and secondary glaucoma are not uncommon sequelae. The iritis is usually managed with local glucocorticoid administration in association with a mydriatic agent. (Kasper, p. 1994)
30. (C) The patient has Marfan syndrome (triad of long thin extremities, lens dislocation, and aortic aneurysms). Aortic involvement occurs in about $80 \%$, with degenerative changes predominating. Aortic root dilatation can cause aortic regurgitation or aortic aneurysm and rupture. (Kasper, pp. 2329-2330)
31. (E) Extra-articular manifestations of RA generally develop in patients with high titers of autoantibody to the Fc component of IgG (also known as rheumatoid factor (RF)). (Kasper, p. 1971)
32. (B) Leukopenia occurs in almost two-thirds of the SLE patients, and the differential count is usually normal. Lymphocytes and platelets can also be reduced. (Kasper, p. 1964)
33. (C) Mononuclear cell infiltration and edema develop in the periosteum, synovial membrane, and joint capsule. Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA) (e.g., lung cancer) is more common than primary HOA. (Kasper, p. 2061)
34. (A) Pleuritis is common at autopsy in patients with RA but is not usually symptomatic. Typically, the pleural fluid shows increased pleural fluid: serum protein and LDH ratios (exudate pattern), and low glucose and low complement levels. Pleuropulmonary manifestations are more common in men with RA. (Kasper, p. 1972)
35. (D) In RA, pleural involvement is very common at autopsy but infrequently causes symptoms. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common manifestation of rheumatoid lung disease. RA associated interstitial lung disease
(RA-ILD) is usually similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in terms of its clinical presentation, pathology, disease spectrum, and pathogenesis. Presentation is more common at age 50-60 years, in men ( $\mathrm{M}: \mathrm{F}=2-3: 1$ ), and in association with seropositive and erosive joint disease. If pleural fluid is present, glucose levels are very low. (Kasper, pp. 1971-1972)
36. (B) Temporal artery biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the presenting symptoms, signs, and routine laboratory tests. The arteritis can be segmental, however, and great care must be taken in the pathologic assessment. (Kasper, p. 2009)
37. (A) This patient has SLE and pericarditis, sometimes leading to tamponade, is the most common manifestation of cardiac disease. Myocarditis does occur and can cause arrhythmias, sudden death, or heart failure. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is associated with thrombotic events or, less commonly, valvular regurgitation. Myocardial infarction is more commonly a result of atherosclerotic disease than vasculitis. (Kasper, p. 1964)
38. (A) In inflammatory bowel disease, there are two common types of arthritis involvement. The first is an asymmetric, migratory polyarthritis that affects the large joints of the lower and upper extremities and is closely related to the activity of bowel disease. Spondylitis is also common (though not always symptomatic) and is not always related to activity of bowel disease. (Kasper, p. 1784)
39. (C) Current treatment for polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) mimics that of Wegener's granulomatosis in the initial treatment with combination steroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. This will result in up to a $90 \%$ long-term remission rate even after discontinuation of therapy. In cases associated with hepatitis B infection, plasmapheresis is sometimes used as initial therapy. (Kasper, p. 2008)
40. (C) Almost all patients with temporal arteritis will have an elevated ESR. Although a highESR cannot make the diagnosis, a normal ESR helps in excluding the diagnosis. C-ANCA is a diagnostic tool for Wegener's granulomatosis. Elevated CPK is not seen in temporal arteritis, even with associated PMR. Normochromic, or slightly hypochromic, anemia often seen in temporal arteritis is too nonspecific to be of much diagnostic help. (Kasper, p. 2009)
41. (C) About $20-30 \%$ of patients with PAN have hepatitis B antigenemia. Circulating immune complexes containing hepatitis B antigen and immunoglobulin have been detected, and immunofluorescence of blood vessel walls have also demonstrated hepatitis B antigen. Antiviral therapy has been used in these cases. (Kasper, p. 2007)
42. (C) This patient has a sacroiliac form of arthritis seen in patients with psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis can develop five different patterns of musculoskeletal symptoms. These include arthritis of the DIP joints; asymmetric oligoarthritis; symmetric polyarthritis similar to RA; spine and sacroiliac type; and arthritis mutilans, a highly destructive form. Most patients with psoriatic arthritis also have nail involvement. Only about a quarter actually develop a progressive, destructive disease. Uric acid may be elevated because of high tissue turnover but is not part of the pathogenesis of joint disease. (Kasper, p. 1998)
43. (A) The presence of RF has little predictive power in determining the diagnosis of RA. However, it is useful in determining prognosis, as high titers of RF are associated with more severe and progressive disease, as well as with extra-articular manifestations. (Kasper, p. 1972)
44. (D) The disease is relapsing polychondritis and is characterized by frequent remissions and exacerbations of lesions and is rarely fatal. Auricular chondritis and nasal chondritis are the most common manifestations. It can also be secondary to SLE, RA, Sjögren's syndrome, and vasculitis. (Kasper, pp. 2015-2016)
45. (E) In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, skin hyperextensibility, fragility, and bruisability are marked,
and this condition may create difficulties at operation. Habitual dislocation of joints is also a characteristic of this syndrome. (Kasper, p. 2328)
46. (C) In traumatic arthritis, swellings, ecchymoses, muscular spasms, and tenderness tend to be present, but fractures must be excluded. This man has calcium pyrophosphate (CPPD) crystalinduced monoarthritis, so called "pseudogout." It is most common in the elderly and can be precipitated by minor trauma. The crystals have a rhomboid shape, and the clinical presentation can mimic that of gout. It can be associated with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperparathyroidism or hemochromatosis. Treatment is with an NSAID for $7-10$ days. If there are multiple joints involved, then steroids can be considered. An alternative to oral NSAIDs is intra-articular steroids for single joint disease. Allopurinol is not effective in CPPD. Synovial fluid is bloody, but the fluid is of normal viscosity, so a "string" test is usually positive. (Kasper, pp. 2047-2048)
47. (A) The course of muscle necrosis in dermatomyositis can be best followed by repeated CK determinations. Repeated muscle biopsies are rarely required. However, the goal of therapy is to increase muscle strength and function, so following muscle strength is the key clinical assessment of response to therapy. (Kasper, p. 2544)
48. (B) This patient with SLE has developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Treatment consists of high-dose oral steroids. The positive Coombs' test (direct antiglobulin test), high indirect bilirubin, high LDH, and high retic count are all supportive of hemolytic anemia. A normal AST and ALT rule out hepatitis. (Kasper, p. 1964)
49. (E) This story is typical of Lyme disease. The spirochete involved (B. burgdorferi) is transmitted by ixodic ticks and is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States. The host animal varies depending on the exact type of tick. Treatment is briefer and more effective earlier in the course of the disease. The treatment of choice is doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1-2 months. Amoxicillin is a second choice drug. (Kasper, pp. 997-998)50. (D) This story is typical of Lyme disease. The spirochete involved (B. burgdorferi) is transmitted by ixodic ticks and is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States. The host animal varies depending on the exact type of tick. Because antibody studies cannot differentiate between active and inactive disease, the appropriate constellation of symptoms is also required for diagnosis. (Kasper, p. 997)
51. (E) As in most inflammatory arthritides, the patient with RA generally has morning stiffness for more than 1 hour. Wrist involvement is nearly universal and is associated with radial deviation (unlike the ulnar deviation of the digits) and carpal tunnel syndrome. Hand involvement characteristically involves the proximal interphalangeal and MCP joints in a symmetric involvement. High fever ( $>100.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ), even with active synovitis, should suggest an intercurrent problem such as infection. (Kasper, pp. 1970-1971)
52. (C) AS occurs in 1-6\% of adults inheriting human lymphocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27). However, the prevalence in B27-positive relatives of patients with AS is up to $30 \%$. Men are three times more likely to be affected. (Kasper, p. 1993)
53. (D) This patient has PMR. It is characterized by stiffness, aching, and pain in proximal muscle groups in the neck, shoulders, back, hips, and thighs. It is considerably more common than temporal arteritis. Both diseases are almost exclusively seen in the over 50 age group. (Kasper, p. 2009)
54. (A) Although all these complications have been reported in giant cell arteritis, the only one with a significant likelihood is blindness secondary to ischemic optic neuropathy. Thus, if the disease is suspected, urgent diagnosis and treatment is required. (Kasper, p. 2009)
55. (C) Although the hallmark of osteoarthritis is the progressive loss of articular cartilage, it is best considered as a disease of the entire organ, the synovial joint, rather than of any of its
component tissues. In fact, all areas of the joint, bone, cartilage, synovium, meniscus, and ligaments are involved. (Kasper, p. 2038)
56. (B) In Marfan syndrome, inheritance is autosomal dominant, and the aortic lesion is a cystic medial necrosis with loss of elastic tissue, resulting in aneurysm formation. Pneumothorax can occur but is not as characteristic. Mitral valve prolapse can also be part of the syndrome. Dislocation of the lens is the most apparent eye abnormality. Severe chest deformities and long limbs are characteristic. High, arched palate; high pedal arches; and pes planus are common. (Kasper, p. 2330)
57. (A) Numerous mediators of inflammation are found in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The evidence favoring activated T cells as the initiators of the inflammation include the predominance of $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+} \mathrm{T}$ cells in the synovium, the increase in soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors (a product of T-cell activation), and amelioration of symptoms by T-cell removal. (Kasper, p. 1969)
58. (C) Methotrexate, $7.5-20 \mathrm{mg}$ once weekly, is the most commonly recommended disease modifying drug, because its effect is more rapid and patients are able to tolerate it for longer periods of time. Maximum improvement with methotrexate occurs after 6 months of therapy. Toxicity includes GI upset, oral ulceration, and liver function abnormalities. GI upset in particular may be ameliorated by concurrent folic acid administration. Pneumonitis has also been reported. (Kasper, p. 1975)
59. (B) ANAs are present in $98 \%$ of patients with SLE. Repeatedly negative tests make the diagnosis of SLE very unlikely. Unfortunately, the test is not specific and may be positive in normal people (especially in older individuals), or secondary to infections, drugs, or other autoimmune disorders. (Kasper, p. 1964)
60. (E) This patient likely has PAN. ANCA and other serology are usually negative in PAN; positive serology suggests another diagnosis. The optimal diagnostic strategy is the biopsy ofan affected organ. However angiography to look for aneurysms of small- and mediumsized arteries generally has higher yield than blind biopsy of unaffected organs. The lungs are not a characteristic site of involvement. (Kasper, p. 2008)
61. (C) This story is typical of Lyme disease. The spirochete involved (B. burgdorferi) is transmitted by ixodic ticks and is most common in the Northeastern and Midwestern parts of the United States. The host animal varies depending on the exact type of tick. (Kasper, p. 996)
62. (B) Although malaise, fatigue, and sweating are common in temporal arteritis, they are too nonspecific to help in making the diagnosis. Claudication of the jaw and tongue, while not very sensitive for temporal arteritis, are more specific than the constitutional symptoms. Odynophagia is not a characteristic of this disease. (Kasper, p. 2009)
63. (D) There are numerous diseases and risk factors associated with the development of osteoarthritis. People of Chinese and African heritage have a lower risk than Caucasians, while Native Americans have a higher risk. Women are more affected than men, and obesity is a significant risk factor. Hyperthyroidism is not one of the many metabolic/endocrine disorders associated with osteoarthritis. (Kasper, pp. 2039-2040)
64. (E) Heberden's nodes, bony enlargement of the DIP joints of the hand, are the most common type of osteoarthritis. Although they can present acutely with pain and inflammation, they are frequently slow in developing and relatively asymptomatic. (Kasper, pp. 2039-2040)
65. (C) Although not specific, ANA is positive in $95 \%$ of patients with SLE. A repeatedly negative test makes SLE unlikely. (Kasper, p. 1961)
66. (F) Anti-dsDNA is relatively disease-specific and associated with nephritis and clinical activity. Anti-single-stranded (ss) DNA is not very specific. (Kasper, p. 1961)
67. (E) The presence of anticardiolipin antibodies is associated with false-positive VDRL, vascular thrombosis, and spontaneous abortion. (Kasper, p. 1961)
68. (D) Antihistone antibodies are seen in $95 \%$ of patients with drug-induced LE and in $70 \%$ of those with SLE. (Kasper, p. 1961)
69. (B) Anti-RNP is found in high titer in syndromes with features of polymyositis, scleroderma, lupus, and mixed connective tissue disease. (Kasper, p. 1961)
70. (B) Although widespread vasculitis is rare, limited forms of vasculitis are not, particularly in White patients with high titers of RF. Cutaneous vasculitis usually presents as crops of small brown spots in the nail beds, nail folds, and digital pulp. (Kasper, p. 1971)
71. (D) Direct eye involvement with the rheumatoid process (episcleritis or scleritis) occurs in less than $1 \%$ of patients. However, $15-20 \%$ may develop Sjögren's syndrome with attendant keratoconjunctivitis sicca. (Kasper, p. 1972)
72. (A) Felty's syndrome consists of chronic RA, splenomegaly, and neutropenia. The increased frequency of infections is due to both decreased number and function of neutrophils. (Kasper, p. 1972)
73. (G) Caplan's syndrome is a diffuse, nodular fibrotic process that may result when rheumatoid nodules occur in the lungs of patients with pneumoconiosis. (Kasper, pp. 1971-1972)
74. (E) Rheumatoid nodules occur in $20-30 \%$ of patients with RA. Common locations include the olecranon bursa, the proximal ulna, the Achillis tendon, and the occiput. (Kasper, p. 1971)
75. (C) Both rickets and osteomalacia are disorders in which mineralization of the organic matrix of the skeleton is defective. Rickets is the name when this disorder occurs in a growing skeleton, whereas osteomalacia occurs after the epiphyseal plates are closed. (Kasper, p. 2247)76. (D) Deficient or defective $1,25(\mathrm{OH}) 2$ vitamin D receptors will result in vitamin D resistance. Parathyroid hormone levels increase secondary to decreased vitamin D effect. The $1(\mathrm{OH})$ vitamin D is an intermediate metabolite. (Kasper, p. 2247)
77. (C) Aging decreases the responsiveness of the renal $25(\mathrm{OH})$ D-1-hydroxylase to parathyroid hormone (PTH), thus decreasing circulatory levels of the active metabolite $1,25(\mathrm{OH}) 2$ vita$\min D$. This results in decreased calcium absorption from the gut. There is not a close relationship of $1(\mathrm{OH})$ vitamin D levels and osteopenia. (Kasper, pp. 2246-2247)
78. (B) Muscle weakness is common in both rickets and osteomalacia, and proximal leg muscles are particularly involved. The combination of leg deformity and muscle weakness in rickets can result in an inability to walk. The presentation of osteomalacia is more insidious in the elderly, but proximal myopathy may be severe enough to cause a waddling gait and mimic a primary muscle disorder. The other clinical findings listed are found only in rickets. (Kasper, p. 2247)
79. (D) The term pseudogout refers to crystal deposition disease not due to uric acid (gout). By far the most common cause of pseudogout is calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD). The major predisposing factors are advanced age and preexisting joint disease. The knee is the most common joint involved, and presentation can mimic acute gout. However, in the majority of cases, the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate seems to be asymptomatic. (Kasper, p. 2047)
80. (E) Unfortunately, there is no medical means to remove the deposits of CPPD. Colchicine does seem to decrease the rate of recurrence. NSAIDs, steroids (systemic or intra-articular), and colchicine are all helpful in acute attacks. (Kasper, pp. 2048-2049)
81. (C) Although gout and CPPD disease are found in chronic renal failure, hydroxyapatite deposition is characteristic of end-stage renal failure. The crystals are very small, nonbirefringent, and only seen on election microscopy. Treatment is symptomatic, and similar to the treatment of gout or CPPD disease. (Kasper, p. 2049)
82. (E) "Milwaukee shoulder" represents an unusual manifestation of calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease. Once destruction changes start occurring, medical management is relatively unsuccessful. The exact reason why destructive arthritis occurs is not understood. The knee is the other joint affected in this manner. (Kasper, p. 2048)
83. (C) The high white cell count suggests infection. In RA and crystal-induced arthritis, the white cell count is usually less than $50,000 / \mu \mathrm{L}$. Staphylococcus aureus infection is the most common type in RA. (Kasper, p. 2050)
84. (B) Churg-Strauss is a granulomatous vasculitis. Pulmonary involvement often dominates the clinical presentation with severe asthma attacks and pulmonary infiltrates. Peripheral eosinophilia is present in virtually all cases. (Kasper, p. 2007)
85. (A) PAN is a multisystem, necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized muscular arteries. Aneurysmal dilations of the arteries are characteristic. Nonspecific signs and symptoms are the usual method of presentation. Renal involvement is clinically present in $60 \%$ of cases and is the most common cause of death in untreated cases. (Kasper, pp. 2007-2008)
86. (F) A high percentage of patients with Wegener's develop ANCAs. In particular, cytoplasmic or c-ANCAs are both sensitive and specific for Wegener's. However, tissue diagnosis is still required. (Kasper, pp. 2004-2006)
87. (C) Henoch-Schönlein purpura, characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgias, GI symptoms, and glomerulonephritis, can be seen in any age-group but is most common in children. It can resolve and recur several times over a period of weeks or months and can resolve spontaneously. (Kasper, p. 2010)
88. (I) Behçet's syndrome is a leukocytoclastic venulitis characterized by episodes of oral ulcers, genital ulcers, iritis, and cutaneous lesions. Eye involvement can rapidly progress to blindness. (Kasper, pp. 2012, 2014)# Infection Questions

For each of the following patients, select the most likely diagnosis.
96. A previously healthy 43-year-old man presents with symptoms of cough, fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy for the past 2 months. His physical examination reveals multiple axillary and cervical lymph nodes and oropharyngeal ulcerations. His CXR reveals fibronodular pulmonary infiltrates in the apex, his sputum is negative for TB, and the HIV test is negative. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) confirms the diagnosis. (SELECT ONE)
97. A 34-year-old man presents with fever, cough, and sputum production. The CXR reveals a thin-walled pulmonary cavity. His tests for TB and HIV are negative. Four weeks ago, he was traveling in southern California, including visiting the San Joaquin valley. While there he did experience a "flu-like" illness, which slowly improved but then his symptoms of cough and sputum started. A BAL confirmed the diagnosis. (SELECT ONE)
98. A 42-year-old man presents with symptoms of cough, sputum, fever, and weight loss. His CXR reveals upper lobe pulmonary infiltrates and his Mantoux test (purified protein derivative [PPD]) is positive. He emigrated from Southeast Asia 3 years ago. (SELECT ONE)
99. A 25-year-old woman presents with fever, night sweats, and muscles aches for the past 1 month. She was previously well. On examination, she has axillary and cervical lymph nodes, but no active joints or hepatosplenomegaly. She currently works on a hog farm. Her investigations are negative for EBV, CMV, and HIV. Serologic tests for the infecting agent confirm the diagnosis in her. (SELECT ONE)100. A 42-year-old man presents with sudden-onset fever, chills, headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias. He has no prior medical history, but noticed a new ulcer on his hand 1 week ago. On examination, there is a small "punched out" ulcer, which is erythematous and indurated on his hand, as well as epitrochlear and axillary lymph nodes that are tender.

105. A 34-year-old man who works as a carpenter presents with symptoms of jaw discomfort, dysphagia, and pain as well as stiffness in his neck, back, and shoulders. On examination, he is unable to open his jaw, his proximal limb muscles are stiff as is his abdomen and back, but the hands and feet are relatively spared. He occasionally has violent generalized muscles spasms that cause him to stop breathing, but there is no loss of consciousness. A clinical diagnosis is made and he is treated with antibiotics, antitoxin, and diazepam as well as muscle relaxants for the spasms. (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (A) In tetanus, an acute onset is usual. The median onset is 7 days, and $90 \%$ present within 14 days of injury. The organism is an anaerobic, motile Gram-positive rod. It has the ability to survive for years in the form of spores, which are resistant to disinfectants and heat. Tetanus can occur in nonimmunized individuals, or those who have neglected their booster shots. Penicillin, or metronidazole, is used in treatment, but their efficacy is not clear. (Kasper, p. 842)
2. (D) EIA is an excellent screening test for HIV infection as it is positive in over $99.5 \%$ of cases. However, it lacks specificity, and in low risk populations, only about $10 \%$ of EIA positive results are true positives. Recent influenza vaccination, acute viral infections, and liver disease are common causes for false positives. The Western blot test is more specific and is the usual confirmatory test, although even more specific tests are now available. (Kasper, pp. 1100-1101)
3. (A) S. aureus causes more than $50 \%$ of cases of native valve endocarditis in drug abusers. The onset is usually acute, and the tricuspid valve is the most commonly affected. In staphylococcal tricuspid endocarditis, septic pulmonary emboli are common. Frequently, no murmur is heard. (Kasper, p. 732)
4. (C) HSV-2 genital infections may be associated with fever, malaise, and anorexia. Vesicular lesions usually ulcerate rapidly and become covered with exudate. There is a $90 \%$ chance of recurrent symptoms in the first year following a primary infection. HSV-1 genital infections
are similar, but the chance of recurrence is less. (Kasper, p. 1037)
5. (D) The presence of IgG antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescence test indicates recent or prior EBV infection. IgM antibodies indicate recent infection only. Heterophil antibodies are present in $50 \%$ of children and $90-95 \%$ of adolescents and adults with infectious mononucleosis. Monospot tests are the best diagnostic tools but may not turn positive until the second or third week of the illness. Specific EBV antibodies and cultures are rarely used. (Kasper, p. 1047)
6. (B) Current recommendations suggest that mild diarrhea be treated with oral rehydration alone, but when enteric symptoms such as cramps are bothersome, treatment with loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate is warranted. More severe infections with severe diarrhea, severe pain, or fever should be treated with antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. (Kasper, p. 728)
7. (B) Pain referring to either or both lower quadrants is common when oophoritis is present. Fever usually accompanies oophoritis. Sterility is not a consequence of mumps oophoritis. (Kasper, p. 1154)
8. (B) Mycoplasmas have no cell walls and have filtration characteristics of viruses, but morphologically are closer to bacteria. The typical M. pneumoniae infection produces an influenzalike respiratory illness characterized by headache, malaise, fever, and cough. If pneumonia occurs, physical examination can berelatively benign despite a grossly abnormal CXR. (Kasper, p. 1008)
9. (A) The x-ray shows a silhouette sign indicating right middle lobe pneumonia. The organism is most likely to be pneumococcus, but care must be taken to consider blockage of the right middle lobe bronchus. (Kasper, p. 1533)
10. (A) The cause of cat-scratch fever is a tiny Gram-negative bacillus, B. henselae. Cats acquire the organism from the soil and inoculate humans via scratches or bites. The disease is generally benign and self-limited, and is treated with analgesics and antipyretics. Encephalitis, seizures, coma, meningitis, and transverse myelitis can occasionally occur even in immunocompetent patients. A variety of antibiotics have been used when severe disease is present but an optimal regimen has not been identified. (Kasper, p. 930)
11. (B) This is a typical case of measles. The Koplik's spots in the mouth are easily missed with poor illumination. They are white blue spots of 1 mm on a red background and are not seen in any other infectious disease. The rash of measles becomes confluent while that of rubella does not. Pneumonia is an infrequent complication but accounts for many measles deaths. Giant cell pneumonia is also seen, most commonly in children suffering with a severe disease such as leukemia or immunodeficiency. Aerosolized ribavirin has been used to treat severe pneumonia secondary to measles, but its efficacy is still unclear. The other potentially lethal complication of measles is encephalitis. (Kasper, p. 1149)
12. (E) About half of all early-onset ( $<60$ days after surgery) prosthetic endocarditis is caused by staphylococcal infection, with S. epidermidis predominating. Early-onset prosthetic endocarditis is generally the result of intraoperative contamination of the prosthesis or a bacteremic postoperative complication. (Kasper, p. 732)
13. (D) This man has a complication of viral influenza; a secondary bacterial pneumonia has developed. This usually occurs 2-3 days
after the initial viral symptoms resolve. Primary viral pneumonia with influenza is not common. S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, and H. influenzae are the most common bacterial invaders in pulmonary complications of influenza. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death and may also be due to S. pneumoniae and $H$. influenzae. Mixed viral and bacterial pneumonia is common; pure viral pneumonia in influenza is uncommon (but can be very severe). (Kasper, p. 1068)
14. (B) S. epidermidis is still the leading cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis in the early postoperative period (usually defined $<2$ months). It is usually the consequence of intraoperative contamination or postoperative bacteremia. Endocarditis occurring 12 months after surgery is usually due to the same organisms that cause native valve endocarditis. (Kasper, p. 736)
15. (D) Although only close contacts need chemoprophylaxis, it is sometimes given more widely than recommended because of community concern. Meningococcal vaccine is effective against serotype A and C, and will prevent late secondary infection in close contacts. Ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are alternatives to rifampin. (Kasper, p. 854)
16. (C) The most common cause of non-EBV mononucleosis-type syndrome is CMV. It is the most common presentation of CMV in nonneonates with normal immune function. (Kasper, p. 1048)
17. (A) Antibiotics, sulfas, steroids, and mumps convalescent sera are of no value. Mouth care, analgesics, and a bland diet are usually recommended. Glucocorticoids are usually prescribed for orchitis, although definite evidence of their effectiveness is lacking. Prevention via vaccination is the preferred strategy for mumps. (Kasper, p. 1155)
18. (A) The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) picture in this individual is consistent with viral meningitis rather than a bacterial process. Enteroviruses are a prominent cause of viral meningitis in the summer and fall months. They receivedtheir name because they multiply in the GI tract. Fever, sometimes associated with respiratory symptoms, is the most common sequela of enterovirus infection. There are about 70 enteroviruses that affect humans. These include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and others. The spectrum of disease includes paralytic disease, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, pleurodynia, exanthems, pericarditis, myocarditis, and nonspecific febrile illnesses. They can on occasion cause fulminant disease in a newborn. The most important enteroviruses are the three poliovirus serotypes. (Kasper, p. 1144)
19. (A) The incubation period of C. botulinum toxin is 18-36 hours but ranges from a few hours to days. There are no sensory symptoms. Foodborne botulinum is associated primarily with home-canned food. Severe foodborne botulinum can produce diplopia, dysarthria, and dysphagia; weakness then can progress rapidly to involve the neck, arms, thorax, and legs. There is usually no fever. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can precede the paralysis or come afterward. (Kasper, p. 842)
20. (D) Heterophil antibody-negative mononucleosis syndrome is the most common manifestation of CMV infection in immunocompetent adults and is more common than the similar syndrome caused by toxoplasmosis. As of yet, no syndromes caused by HHV-7 have been identified in adults. (Kasper, p. 1050)
21. (E) Coccidioidomycosis is the usual cause of pulmonary cavitation resulting from fungal infection. A rarefaction may be demonstrable in a pneumonic lesion within 10 days of onset. In the United States, most cases are acquired in California, Arizona, and western Texas. (Kasper, p. 1181)
22. (C) The most common complication of measles is otitis media, other complications include mastoiditis, pneumonia, bronchitis, encephalitis, and lymphadenitis. Otitis media is usually a bacterial superinfection, and should be treated with antibiotics. (Kasper, p. 1149)
23. (D) Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis causes involuntary spasmodic movements and progressive mental deterioration, frequently ending in death within a year. It usually occurs in children whose measles occurred at an early age ( $=2$ years). It occurs 6-8 years after the primary infection. It presents with nonspecific symptoms such as poor school performance or mood and personality changes. It then progresses to intellectual decline, seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, and visual disturbances. Continued deterioration results in inevitable death. (Kasper, p. 1150)
24. (E) Demonstration of hematophagous trophozoites of E. histolytica in stool confirms the diagnosis. The trophozoites are rapidly killed by drying, so wet mounts of stool should be examined. (Kasper, p. 1216)
25. (B) Since the introduction of $H$. influenzae type B vaccine, S. pneumoniae has become the most common type of meningitis in infants and toddlers. (Kasper, p. 810)
26. (D) Pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy within 4 weeks of vaccination is a contraindication to receiving the rubella vaccine. There is a theoretical concern that fetus might develop congenital rubella syndrome from the live attenuated virus used for the vaccine. Vaccination is usually given to children combined with measles and mumps vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, and then repeated during childhood at age 4-6 years. It is given even to children with HIV infection. Infants $<1$ year old can be given the vaccine but may not develop adequate immunity and should still be given the recommended two doses. (Kasper, p. 1152)
27. (C) The clinical manifestations of infective endocarditis are a result of three factors: (1) direct infection in the heart, (2) septic emboli, and (3) high levels of circulating immune complexes. Glomerulonephritis, arthritis, and many of the mucocutaneous lesions are secondary to circulating immune complexes. Renal emboli cause hematuria and flank pain, but rarely impair renal function. (Kasper, p.734)28. (B) Adequate rest is the treatment of choice, but forced bed rest is not necessary. Glucocorticoids hasten defervescence and resolution of pharyngitis but are not routinely used. Acyclovir halts oropharyngeal shedding of EBV but has minimal effect on the clinical disease. Similarly alpha-interferon and ganciclovir have antiviral efficacy but have no role to play in uncomplicated infectious mononucleosis. Antibiotics are not helpful, and ampicillin is likely to cause a pruritic maculopapular rash in most patients. (Kasper, p. 1048)
29. (C) Donovanosis, or granuloma inguinale, is a mildly contagious, chronic, indolent disease that can be sexually transmitted. Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, a Gramnegative intracellular bacterium, is felt to be the cause. It is endemic in many tropical areas. Daily doxycycline or weekly azithromycin until the lesions are healed are the usual treatments. Erythromycin is used in pregnant patients. (Kasper, pp. 932-933)
30. (B) S. pneumoniae colonizes the nasopharynx of $5-10 \%$ of healthy adults and up to $20-40 \%$ of children. The source of pneumococcal meningitis is either direct extension from middle ear or sinus infections, or via seeding from a bacteremia. In the latter circumstance, bacteremia from pneumonia would be more likely than from infective endocarditis. (Kasper, pp. 807-808)
31. (C) The patient is infected with Pneumocystis organisms invading an immunocompromised host. The treatment of choice is trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. Alternate therapies include pentamidine (highly toxic) and trimetrexate plus folinic acid. (Kasper, p. 1195)
32. (D) All the sites mentioned can be involved by amebiasis, but the liver is the most common. Most travelers who develop an amebic liver abscess will do so within a few months of their return. Pleuropulmonary and pericardial involvement results from extension from the liver. (Kasper, p. 1215)
33. (D) Acute and convalescent titres of specific IgG antibodies will confirm the diagnosis of
mumps. A single test revealing a specific IgM antibody can also confirm the disease. Urine, saliva, and throat swabs will grow the mumps virus, but blood does not. Salivary amylase is elevated but is relatively nonspecific. Of course, a typical presentation during an epidemic probably does not require any confirmatory tests. Sporadic cases require more active confirmation. Other causes of parotitis requiring specific treatment include calculi, bacterial infections, and drugs. Tumors, sarcoid, TB, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, Sjögren's syndrome, and lupus erythematosus can also cause parotid enlargement. (Kasper, p. 1155)
34. (A) Staphylococcal enterotoxin food poisoning is characterized by violent GI upset with severe nausea, cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. It occurs very rapidly after ingestion (1-6 hours) and usually resolves by 12 hours. (Kasper, p. 819)
35. (C) The patient has tinea capitis, which may be caused by Trichophyton or Microsporum species. It may be successfully treated with topical azole drugs (e.g., clotrimazole). More severe infections are usually treated with systemic medications. (Kasper, p. 1191)
36. (C) Coxsackie A viruses may cause a number of syndromes, including herpangina, exanthem, aseptic meningitis, common cold, paralysis, pneumonitis, and summer febrile illness. It is distinguished from HSV-1 herpes stomatitis by the fact that most of the lesions are concentrated in the posterior portion of the mouth and that there is no gingivitis. The other virus does not cause oral lesions. HSV-2 can occasionally cause oral lesions. (Kasper, p. 1145)
37. (B) Rabies is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals. Once clinical signs develop, the disease is almost $100 \%$ fatal. Symptoms of rabies may include apathy as well as hyperexcitability. Finding Negri bodies in nerve cells of the brain in infected animals confirms the diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction for detection of viral material is another method of confirming the diagnosis. In cats and dogs that are not available for observation (lasting 10 days) to determine if they have signs of rabies, publichealth authorities should be consulted to determine the potential risk of rabies in the animal based on local rates of rabies in wild animals. Alternatively if there is a high risk the animal is infected, then postexposure prophylaxis should be started with rabies vaccination on days 0,3 , 7,14 , and 28 as well as one dose of rabies immune globulin on day 0. (Kasper, p. 1156)
38. (C) EBV genetic material has been found in association with many malignancies. In Africa, about $90 \%$ of patients with Burkitt's lymphoma have an association with EBV, but in the United States, only $15 \%$ of cases are associated with EBV. In contrast, almost all cases of anaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and also HIVrelated CNS lymphomas are associated with EBV genetic material. (Kasper, p. 1047)
39. (C) Splenic rupture occurs during the second or third week of the illness and can be insidious or abrupt in presentation. Surgery is required. Hemorrhage is not a usual complication of infectious mononucleosis. Over $90 \%$ of cases are benign and uncomplicated, but liver involvement is clinical in 5-10\%. Over 85\% of EBV-associated neurologic problems resolve spontaneously. Although hemorrhage does not occur, autoimmune hemolytic anemia can occur. It is usually mediated by IgM antibodies with anti-i specificity. (Kasper, p. 1047)
40. (B) Coccidioidomycosis may present with a syndrome of erythema nodosum, fever, and conjunctivitis. Serious complications include cavitating lung lesions or meningitis. (Kasper, p. 1181)
41. (D) CMV is probably transmitted in the leukocyte component of transfusions. The syndromes include fever and lymphocytosis. Screening donors for this virus reduces the incidence of transmission. (Kasper, p. 1050)
42. (A) TSS is most characteristically seen in females using vaginal tampons and is secondary to staphylococcal enterotoxins called TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1). Abrupt onset is characteristic. The clinical criteria for diagnosis include high fever, a diffuse rash that desquamates on the
palms and soles over the subsequent 1-2 weeks, hypotension, and involvement in three or more organ systems. This involvement can include GI dysfunction (vomiting and diarrhea), renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, myalgias with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, and delirium. Staphylococcal scaled skin syndrome most often affects newborns and children. It results in localized or quite extensive fluid-filled blisters that easily rupture to expose denuded skin. It is caused by an exfoliative toxin. (Kasper, p. 819)
43. (A) In epidemics, $N$. meningitidis is usually the cause, generally serotype A (sub-Saharan Africa) or C (North America). Serotype B is more common in sporadic outbreaks. (Kasper, p. 849)
44. (A) Several antibiotic combinations could be used and may vary with the indigenous organisms. Aminoglycoside and cephalosporin are commonly used in combination. The antibiotic combination must cover both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Antifungal or viral agents are not empirically started unless there is an appropriate clinical fungal or viral infection. In some centers, empiric antifungal agents are started if the patient remains febrile on antibiotics after 5 days. Observation alone is not an option, since these individuals usually have some form of bacteremia causing the fever. (Kasper, p. 479)
45. (A) Hospital-acquired pneumonia is defined as pneumonia occurring $>48$ hours after admission and not incubating at the time of admission. It is caused by S. aureus, Gram-negative bacilli, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections are also common. Pulmonary embolism is always a consideration in the diagnosis based on clinical probability. The elevated WBC makes atelectasis unlikely and the normal JVP rules out congestive heart failure. (Kasper, p. 1538)
46. (B) Legionnaires' disease is transmitted via infectious aerosols and may cause severe disease characterized by dry cough and fevers. Mild infections and asymptomatic seroconversion also occur. Natural reservoirs for theorganisms include streams, hot springs, and stagnant lakes. Amplifiers are man-made water supplies that favor growth of legionellae. Common amplifiers are hot water systems and heat exchange units. Treatment of choice is either a newer generation macrolide-like azithromycin, or a respiratory quinolone-like levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Erythromycin is also an option but the newer macrolides are better tolerated. Tetracyclines or TMP/SMX are second line options, and the cephalosporins are not effective for legionella. (Kasper, p. 872)
47. (E) Prophylactic antibiotics can prevent enteric bacterial infections, but at the cost of drug side effects (rash, Clostridium difficile colitis) and the possibility of developing an infection with a drug-resistant organism. Most experts recommend against taking daily prophylaxis unless the consequences of traveler's diarrhea outweigh the risks of the side effects. Such individuals include patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or immunocompromised states like transplant recipients. Bismuth subsalicylate at a dosage of two tablets ( 525 mg ) four times a day is safe and effective for up to 3 weeks, but can be difficult to take because of the large quantity required. It is also only $60 \%$ effective in preventing symptoms. Improving food and drink selection and appropriate caution are the best advice, and medications are only indicated if moderate or severe symptoms develop, including taking loperamide for severe diarrhea. (Kasper, p. 728)
48. (B) Figure 10-2 illustrates Hutchinson's teeth, which is a manifestation of late congenital syphilis. This may be associated with cardiovascular and neurologic manifestations as well as "saddle nose" and "saber shins." (Kasper, p. 981)
49. (C) The findings of SBP can be subtle and not as dramatic as that of secondary peritonitis (when bacteria contaminate the peritoneum). As many as $80 \%$ of patients with SBP will present with fever. Preexisting ascites is almost always present, but only $10 \%$ of cirrhotics at most will develop SBP. The microbiology is characteristically that of a single organism (E. coli most commonly). Polymicrobial
infection should suggest the possibility of peritonitis secondary to a perforation. More than $300 \mathrm{PMNs} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ of ascitic fluid is said to be diagnostic. (Kasper, p. 750)
50. (E) Mumps is an acute, communicable infection with localized swelling of one or more salivary glands. At times, gonads, meninges, pancreas, and other organs can be involved. Up to $25 \%$ of infections are inapparent clinically. The virus is transmitted in saliva but is also found in urine, and this might be another source of transmission. (Kasper, p. 1154)
51. (C) Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete B. burgdorferi, a fastidious microaerophilic bacterium. It is a tick-transmitted disease but is not caused by the tick. The incubation period is 3-32 days and is associated, initially, with minimal immune response. Perhaps as many as $25 \%$ of patients lack the characteristic skin lesion. (Kasper, p. 996)
52. (C) Infectious mononucleosis is an acute, selflimited infection of the lymphatic system by the EBV. Typical infectious mononucleosis has an incubation period of 4-8 weeks. The prodrome includes malaise, anorexia, and chills, and then the classic symptoms of pharyngitis, fever, and lymphadenopathy develop. Headache is also common. (Kasper, p. 1046)
53. (E) The time course, clinical features, and stool examination are characteristic of intestinal amebiasis. It is very common in most developing countries in the tropics and infects about $10 \%$ of the world's population. It is the third most common cause of death from parasitic disease. (Kasper, p. 1215)
54. (B) In adults (age $>15$ years), S. pneumoniae is the single most common organism, accounting for one-third to one-half of all cases. This pneumococcal predominance is even more pronounced in sporadic cases. (Kasper, p. 2471)
55. (C) Orchitis occurs in about $20 \%$ of males, but is usually unilateral, thus sterility is rare. The disease is caused by a paramyxovirus and one infection confers lifelong immunity. The incubationperiod is 14-18 days. Serum amylase is elevated in most cases of mumps because of parotitis, not pancreatitis. Other complications include thyroiditis, myocarditis, and polyarthritis. (Kasper, p. 1154)
56. (B) The most common cause of traveler's diarrhea worldwide is toxigenic E. coli. In North Africa and Southeast Asia, Campylobacter infections predominate. Other causative organisms include Salmonella, Shigella, rotavirus, and the Norwalk agent. The most common parasite causing traveler's diarrhea is Giardia lamblia. (Kasper, p. 728)
57. (D) Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus with worldwide distribution. In the United States, it is particularly common in Southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and Central states. It is frequently found in soil enriched by droppings of certain birds and bats. Caves are common sites of infection. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and require no therapy. Acute disseminated infection usually occurs in patients with HIV infection or other immunocompromised states, but chronic dissemination can occur in immunocompetent patients. Findings may include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, anemia, and Addison's disease. Mediastinal fibrosis can result in superior vena cava compression. Fibrosis can also involve the pulmonary arteries, esophagus, and pulmonary veins. Only rare nonviable organisms are found on pathologic examination in such cases. The prognosis is generally poor. (Kasper p. 1179)
58. (C) This woman likely has native valve endocarditis, probably in the setting of a previous valvular abnormality. Streptococci cause over half the cases of native valve endocarditis in nonintravenous drug abusers. Of these, $75 \%$ are viridans streptococci. Streptococcus bovis is the most common nonviridans streptococcus causing endocarditis and is usually found in the older population ( 60 years), particularly if bowel lesions are present. Staphylococcal endocarditis is the next most common type, but it is usually associated with a more acute
presentation. Enterococci cause about $6 \%$ of cases in native valve endocarditis, but fungi are rare causes. (Kasper, p. 732)
59. (E) Cytotoxic chemotherapy frequently results in neutropenia and subsequently Gram-negative bacillary infection. Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Candida, and Aspergillus infections are also common. (Kasper, p. 479)
60. (D) Selective immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency predisposes to G. lamblia infection, hepatitis virus, and S. pneumoniae. H. influenzae infection occurs, but this is not as characteristic as Giardia. (Kasper, p. 1944)
61. (D, F, G) Defects in the complement pathway predisposes individuals to recurrent infections with encapsulated organisms such as $H$. influenzae, Neisseria species, or S. pneumonia. (Kasper, p. 1928)
62. (B) All forms of T-lymphocyte deficiency/ dysfunction are characterized by candidal infections. Candida species can cause thrush, skin lesions, esophagitis, and cystitis. Hematogenous spread can occur and disseminate the organism widely in individuals with low CD4 counts. (Kasper, pp. 1940-1941)
63. (D) Patients with myeloma have defects in humoral immunity and are prone to recurrent pneumonias due to S. pneumoniae. Lung infections with S. aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are also frequent. E. coli and other Gramnegatives cause recurrent urinary tract infections. (Kasper, p. 657)
64. (A) The preformed toxin of Staphylococcus causes nausea within 1-6 hours of ingestion. Ham, poultry, potato and egg salad, mayonnaise, and cream pastries are common food sources. (Kasper, p. 819)
65. (D) Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes $15-50 \%$ of traveler's diarrhea, depending on geographic location. The incubation period is more than 16 hours, and water and many foods can be the source. (Kasper, p. 728)66. (F) Shigella causes an invasive diarrhea with blood and has an incubation period of more than 16 hours. Potato and egg salad, lettuce, and raw vegetables are common food sources. (Kasper, p. 904)
67. (C) Vibrio cholerae causes profuse watery diarrhea with an incubation period of more than 16 hours. Shellfish are a common source. (Kasper, p. 912)
68. (H) B. cereus causes an early onset of food poisoning when found in fried rice. This occurs within 1-6 hours and, like staphylococcal food poisoning, is characterized by vomiting. The enteric form of B. cereus food poisoning is characterized by watery diarrhea and occurs $8-16$ hours after ingestion of contaminated food such as meat, vegetables, dried beans, or cereals. (Kasper, p. 758)
69. (D) The location of infection, the possibility of tick exposure, and the nonspecific nature of the presentation are consistent with a rickettsial infection, likely RMSF. (Kasper, p. 1000)
70. (B) The diagnosis is usually made by proximal to distal "milking of the urethra" and showing evidence of a purulent or mucopurulent discharge. Other methods include examining a urethral swab or the sediment from the first $20-30 \mathrm{~mL}$ of voided urine (after the patient has not voided for several hours). Dysuria without inflammation may represent a functional problem and usually does not benefit from antibiotics. (Kasper, p. 764)
71. (E) Doxycycline is the treatment of choice, with tetracycline as the second choice. There is insufficient evidence to determine the exact role of fluoroquinolones in RMSF. Beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, and aminoglycosides are of no value. Sulfa-containing drugs may actually exacerbate the condition. Glucocorticoids have not been shown to be helpful, but meticulous control of volume status is important. (Kasper, p. 1001)
72. (B) Although all the skin problems listed have been described with M. pneumoniae infection, the only clearly linked entity is erythema multiforme. (Kasper, p. 1009)
73. (B) C. trachomatis causes $30-40 \%$ of cases in the United States. The exact prevalence depends on the effectiveness of Chlamydial control programs in the population. The other organisms can all cause urethritis in men. (Kasper, p. 763)
74. (A) HSV and C. albicans are the common causes of vulvar infection. Although they can cause dysuria, it is of the "external" variety (i.e., secondary to urine passing over the inflamed vulvar area). The other infections cause "internal dysuria" and/or vaginal discharge. (Kasper, p. 765)
75. (A) Pulmonary and systemic microcirculation are the primary targets of the disease. The resultant damage results in increased vascular permeability. This can cause edema, decreased plasma volume, decreased albumin, prerenal azotemia, and even hypotension. Involvement of the pulmonary microcirculation can result in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. (Kasper, p. 1000)
76. (E) Empiric treatment should include coverage for both Chlamydial infection (with azithromycin) and $N$. gonorrhoeae infection (usually with ceftriaxone). There are numerous alternatives for N. gonorrhoeae infection, such as oral cefixime (not available in the United States), oral ciprofloxacin, or intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone. However, resistance to penicillin is too common to allow the routine use of this drug. (Kasper, p. 765)
77. (D) There is a definite midwinter spike in bacteremia in adults, but not in children. Invasive disease is highest in children under 2 years of age. Bacteremia is more common in certain groups (e.g., Native Americans, Native Alaskans, African Americans), suggesting a genetic predisposition. Up to $40 \%$ of healthy children and $10 \%$ of healthy adults are asymptomaticcarriers. In adults, the organism can persist in the nasopharynx for up to 6 months. (Kasper, p. 806)
78. (C) The most specific immunologic defense is directed at capsular antigens and is serotype specific. Antibodies are not naturally occurring, but are the result of prior colonization, infection, or vaccination. Intact spleen, complement and macrophage function is important in clearance of pneumococci from sterile areas, but specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody coating of a pneumococcal polysaccharide capsule is essential for macrophages to ingest and kill the bacteria. (Kasper, p. 807)
79. (B) Infections of the middle ear, trachea, sinuses, bronchi, and lungs are caused by direct spread from nasopharyngeal colonization. Disease of the CNS, heart valves, bones, joints, and peritoneal are usually caused by hematogenous dissemination. (Kasper, p. 808)
80. (D) There is no need to investigate or treat an asymptomatic male partner. If candidal dermatitis of the penis is present, topical azole therapy would be appropriate. (Kasper, p. 768)
81. (D) Although all these can be manifestations of RMSF, encephalitis as manifested by confusion or lethargy is by far the most common CNS manifestation. It occurs in about one-quarter of cases, and can progress to coma. (Kasper, p. 1001)
82. (B) It is possible that such outbreaks can occur in people with no predisposing factors, unlike the vast majority of sporadic cases. However, the only common predisposing factor in a young healthy population such as this would be a previous viral respiratory infection. (Kasper, p. 807)
83. (B) Approximately $2 \%$ of cases of pneumococcal pneumonia are complicated by empyema. However, not all pleural effusions in the setting of pneumococcal pneumonia represent pleural infection. Frank pus, a positive Gram stain, or a $\mathrm{pH}=7.1$ on thoracentesis suggest empyema and the need for aggressive drainage. (Kasper, p. 810)
84. (C) The most common presentation is with cough and headache. Both can be quite severe. Cough becomes more prominent if a lower respiratory tract infection ensues, but sputum production is not usually prominent. Shaking chills and pleuritic chest pain are quite uncommon. (Kasper, p. 1009)
85. (D) RMSF is the most severe of the rickettsial diseases and has been documented in 48 American states, Canada, and parts of Central and South America. The specific tick that is the vector for this rickettsial disease varies in different geographical locations. (Kasper, p. 999)
86. (D) Sulfonamides and trimethoprim competitively inhibit enzymes involved in folic acid biosynthesis. (Kasper, pp. 789-793)
87. (E) Ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and metronidazole inhibit DNA synthesis, albeit by different mechanisms. (Kasper, pp. 789-793)
88. (A) Beta-lactams can be inactivated by betalactamase. (Kasper, pp. 789-793)
89. (C) Macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin, erythromycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and chloramphenicol inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit. Tetracyclines and aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. (Kasper, pp. 789-793)
90. (E) Some Gram-negative bacteria acquire mutations in their outer membrane pori, so they are no longer permeable to ciprofloxacin. Some Gram-positive bacteria develop a mutation that allows them to actively pump the drug out. The most common form of resistance, however, is a mutation in the DNA gyrase, which is the target of ciprofloxacin action. (Kasper, pp. 789-793)
91. (F) Rifampin is an excellent inducer of many cytochrome P450 enzymes and increases the hepatic clearance of a number of drugs, including oral contraceptives. (Kasper, p. 789-806)92. (D) Sulfonamides potentiate the effects of oral hypoglycemics through reduction in metabolism or displacement from serum protein. (Kasper, pp. 789-806)
93. (E) Metronidazole can cause a disulfiram-like syndrome when alcohol is ingested. Instructions to avoid alcohol should be given when this drug is prescribed. (Kasper, pp. 789-806)
94. (F) Rifampin's enzyme-induction properties can result in increased metabolism of cyclosporine, with resultant organ rejection. In contrast, erythromycin inhibits the enzyme involved in cyclosporine metabolism and can result in enhanced toxicity. (Kasper, pp. 789-806)
95. (D) Sulfonamides may potentiate the effects of phenytoin through reduction in metabolism or displacement from serum protein. (Kasper, pp. 789-806)
96. (C) Disseminated histoplasmosis has many features in common with hematogenously disseminated TB. Common findings include fever, weight loss, cough, lymphadenopathy, anemia, abnormal liver enzymes, and hepatosplenomegaly. The chronic pulmonary disease is characterized by cough, increasing sputum production, and apical infiltrates. Onethird improve or stabilize spontaneously while the remainder progress slowly to develop cavitation of the upper lobes and altered pulmonary function. In histoplasmosis, oropharyngeal ulcerations begin as solitary indurated plaques with no pain present at first, although eventually pain becomes deep-seated. These oropharyngeal manifestations are usually part of disseminated infection. (Kasper, p. 1179)
97. (B) In coccidioidomycosis, hemoptysis may call attention to cavitations, or patients may complain of pain at the cavity site. Only half of the patients with a thin-walled pulmonary cavity secondary to coccidioidomycosis will have symptoms, however. (Kasper, p. 1180)
98. (G) The intracutaneous tuberculin test with purified protein derivative (PPD) is read for
evidence of delayed hypersensitivity at 48 hours. Although induration $>10 \mathrm{~mm}$ is felt to be positive, interpretation is really dependent on the population being studied. In an HIV-infected patient, any reaction should be considered significant. When testing household contacts, $>5 \mathrm{~mm}$ is probably enough to warrant prophylactic treatment. (Kasper, p. 953)
99. (A) In the United States, brucellosis is rare and found most commonly among farmers, meat-processing workers, and veterinarians. Transmission is by contact of Brucella organisms with abraded skin, through the conjunctiva, or by inhalation. Person-to-person transmission is rare or nonexistent. The disease can be acute, localized, or chronic. It requires prolonged antibiotic treatment. A typical treatment course would be doxycycline plus an aminoglycoside for 4 weeks followed by a further 4 weeks of doxycycline and rifampin. (Kasper, p. 914)
100. (H) Tularemia can be acquired through direct contact with an infected rabbit, which may occur in preparation or cooking inadequately. The incubation period is $2-5$ days, and the syndrome includes fevers, chills, headaches, myalgias, and tender hepatosplenomegaly. In addition, specific syndromes such as ulceroglandular or oculoglandular tularemia can accompany the nonspecific syndrome. (Kasper, p. 917)
101. (C) On dark-field examination, T. pallidum (the spirochete that causes syphilis) is a thin, delicate organism with tapering ends and 6-14 spirals. When dark-field examination is not possible, direct fluorescent antibody tests are used. (Kasper, p. 977)
102. (A) Congenital toxoplasmosis is initiated in utero usually as a complication of a primary infection. Infants may be asymptomatic at birth but later can present with a multitude of signs and symptoms, including chorioretinitis, strabismus, epilepsy, and psychomotor retardation. The presence of hydrocephalus is a bad prognostic sign. (Kasper, p. 1243)103. (G) Salmonellosis is an acute infection resulting from ingestion of food containing bacteria and is characterized by abdominal pain and diarrhea. Salmonella gastroenteritis is not usually treated with antibiotics because the length of the illness is not shortened, but the length of time the organism is carried is increased. Antibiotics are used for more serious systemic Salmonella infections. (Kasper, p. 897)
104. (F) Preventive measures are not used because smallpox is thought to be eradicated worldwide, and vaccination may be associated with serious side effects. As humans are the only
reservoir for smallpox, there is no longer any risk of infection from natural sources. However, smallpox could be used in bioterrorism. (Kasper, p. 1284)
105. (B) Patients with tetanus develop hypertonus, seizures, respiratory distress, and asphyxia unless they are treated with diazepam and muscle relaxants. The treatment of tetanus requires diazepam, muscle relaxants, antitoxin, respiratory care, and managing autonomic dysfunction. Antibiotics are given but are probably of little help.

35. A 69-year-old man is receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. (SELECT ONE)
36. A young woman with ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (E) Drug hypersensitivity is the most common cause of serum sickness. It is believed that the drug acts as a hapten binding to a plasma protein. The resultant drug-protein complex induces an immune response. Common signs and symptoms include fever, skin rash (urticarial or morbilliform), arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and albuminuria. Arthritis, nephritis, neuropathy, and vasculitis are less common. Primary sensitization requires 1-3 weeks, but symptoms can occur rapidly on reexposure. (Kasper, p. 319)
2. (B) The major reaction to fungal infections such as histoplasmosis is delayed-type hypersensitivity. This is a reaction of T cells, which have been stimulated by antigen to react against infectious agents, grafts, and tumors. A classic example is the response to the tuberculin skin test in a person previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms which occurs between 48 and 72 hours after antigen exposure. (Kasper, pp. 1179, 1940-1941)
3. (B) NK cells may be of T-cell lineage or monocyte-macrophage lineage. They appear to play an important role in surveillance mechanisms. (Braunwald, pp. 1911-1913)
4. (A) Allergic asthma is often associated with a personal and/or family history of allergic diseases. It is dependent on an IgE response controlled by T and B lymphocytes and activated when antigens interact with mast cell-bound IgE molecules. Most provoking allergens are airborne. Allergic asthma can be seasonal. (Kasper, pp. 1954-1955)
5. (C) Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant condition. The lesions are tense, rounded, nonpitting, and several centimeters in diameter. The edema, unlike urticaria, involves deeper tissue and is not pruritic. Edema of the glottis is the usual cause of death. (Kasper, pp. 1951-1953)
6. (B) Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is characterized by lymphopenia, with a selective diminution of helper T cells. Likely infectious complications and their appropriate prophylaxis can be predicted by the CD4 Tlymphocyte count. Lymphocyte dysfunction can occur even when severe lymphopenia is not yet present. (Kasper, pp. 1104-1105)
7. (A) Thymic tumors may be associated with myasthenia gravis, red cell aplasia, polymyositis, hemolytic anemia, pemphigus, and agranulocytosis. There is also an association with immunodeficiency and thymoma. These patients have B-lymphocyte deficiency and bacterial infections and diarrhea. Erythroid aplasia may develop as well. (Kasper, pp. 2518-2522)
8. (C) Autoantibodies can be demonstrated by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy on the basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli in Goodpasture's syndrome. The disease is most common in young men but can strike at any age. The hemoptysis can be minimal or massive. The course of the hemoptysis is variable, but renal involvement is often progressive. Current therapy includes intensive plasma exchange, cytotoxic agents, and glucocorticoids. Other causes of lung-renal syndromessuch as various vasculitides, Wegener's granulomatosis, mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are not characterized by antibodies to basement membranes. (Kasper, pp. 1560, 1676-1677)
9. (C) Immune complexes are not detected in ATN, Wegener's, HUS, or Goodpasture's syndrome. Immune complexes with low complement levels can be seen in idiopathic and postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus, cryoglobulinemia, shunt nephritis, and bacterial endocarditis. Immune complexes with normal complement levels are found in IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. (Kasper, pp. 1680-1681)
10. (E) These systemic reactions are uncommon and easily managed in the office if detected, but if the patient leaves too soon, it could be dangerous. The exact mechanism of benefit for hyposensitization therapy is unclear. No single measurement of immune function correlates well with clinical efficacy, suggesting a complex of effects that likely includes a reduction in T-cell cytokine production. This type of therapy is reserved for clearly seasonal diseases that cannot be adequately managed with drugs. (Kasper, pp. 1949-1950)
11. (C) The symptoms of serum sickness are usually self-limited and may recur after apparent recovery. The natural course is $1-3$ weeks. Recurrence can occur rapidly (12-36 hours) if repeat exposure to the offending antigen occurs. (Kasper, pp. 319, 2013)
12. (E) A positive skin test with C. albicans extract (erythema and induration of 10 mm or more at 48 hours) excludes virtually all primary T-cell defects. Lymphocyte enumeration and responses to mitogens are much costlier tests. Serum IgA levels are a good screening test for agammaglobulinemia, and the nitroblue tetrazolium assay is useful to detect killing defects of phagocyte cells. (Kasper, pp. 1940-1941)
13. (E) Although urticaria can involve any epidermal or mucosal surface, the palms and soles are usually spared. The associated itching indicates
stimulation of nociceptive nerves. The increased blood flow results in erythema that blanches on pressure. An ongoing, immediate hypersensitivity reaction in association with degranulation of mast cells is the most common cause. (Kasper, pp. 1949-1950)
14. (D) This represents a case of generalized heat urticaria or cholinergic urticaria rather than exercise-induced urticaria. The latter is characterized by larger lesions and possible anaphylactic reactions and is not triggered by hot showers. Although thought to be cholinergically mediated, atropine does not block symptoms in generalized heat urticaria. Because anaphylaxis does not occur and hydroxyzine is so effective, hot showers are not a great danger. (Kasper, pp. 1951-1953)
15. (D) Angioedema is often not itchy and, like urticaria, is transient; manifestation peaks in minutes to hours and disappears over hours to days. The fluid extravasates from deeper areas such as dermal and subdermal sites. Unlike other causes of edema, angioedema is not dependent and can involve all epidermal and submucosal surfaces, although the lips, tongue, eyelids, genitalia, hands, and feet are the most commonly involved. (Kasper, p. 1951)
16. (E) Anaphylaxis is characterized by an initial exposure followed by the formation of specific IgE antibody. Repeat exposure results in antigen combining with IgE bound to basophils and mast cells and subsequent degranulation. Anaphylactoid reactions, such as those to radiographic contrast media, are generally not immunemediated and do not require prior exposure. Insulin and folic acid rarely cause anaphylaxis. Similarly, erythromycin is not a common antibiotic to cause anaphylaxis. Nuts, eggs, seafood, and chocolate are among the many foods implicated in anaphylaxis. (Kasper, pp. 1949-1950)
17. (D) Even in advanced AIDS, only a minority of $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$lymphocytes are actually infected. Numerous other factors, including "innocent bystander destruction" and autoimmune phenomena, might be implicated. Impaired solubleantigen recognition by T lymphocytes can occur when absolute counts are still normal. Polyclonal activation of B cells, which occurs early in the disease, is unlikely to be triggered by direct HIV infection of B cells. Macrophages are felt to be particularly important in carrying the virus across the blood-brain barrier. Circulating immune complexes might help explain arthralgias, myalgias, renal disease, and vasculitis that occur in infected individuals. (Kasper, pp. 1086-1087)
18. (B) The three most common causes of focal brain lesion in HIV disease are toxoplasmosis, primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Toxoplasmosis lesions are typically multiple, spherical, and ring-enhancing on CT scan. They are most likely located in the basal ganglia and the cortex. The symptoms develop characteristically over days and global brain dysfunction is common. Lymphoma presents with one or relatively few irregular weakly enhancing lesions more commonly in the periventricular area. PML presents with multiple nonenhancing lesions in the white matter. CMV, herpes, and Cryptococcus generally cause diffuse brain disease. Glioblastoma multiforme is not characteristic of HIV disease. (Kasper, pp. 1115-1119)
19. (C) There is a constant state of hyperreactivity of the bronchi, during which exposure to an irritant precipitates an asthmatic attack. A following subacute phase has been described that can lead to late complications. The presence of inflammation in the airways has resulted in increased usage of inhaled corticosteroids for maintenance therapy. Many cases of asthma have no discernible allergic component. (Kasper, pp. 1508-1509)
20. (C) Sulfites, used to keep salad greens fresh, can cause severe asthmatic reactions. Other sulfite-containing foods include fresh fruits, potatoes, shellfish, and wine. Aspirin, tartrazine (a coloring agent), and beta-adrenergic agonists also commonly provoke asthmatic attacks. (Kasper, p. 1510)
21. (A) Penicillin can cause numerous allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, rashes (the most common manifestation), urticaria, fever, pneumonitis, dermatitis, and even asthma in workers exposed to airborne penicillin. Hemolytic anemia is often IgGmediated. Skin tests are reliable in predicting low risk (similar to general population) for those claiming previous penicillin reactions, and desensitization is feasible. The frequency of reactions to cephalosporins in penicillinallergic patients is not definitely known. (Kasper, pp. 1947-1951)
22. (B) ACE inhibitors can cause angioedema of the face and oropharyngeal structures. This is felt to be a pseudoallergic reaction, possibly due to the drug's effect on the kinin system. It is thought that reactions may be more common in women, Blacks, and those with idiopathic angioedema. If this occurs, therapy with alternate ACE inhibitors should not be attempted. (Kasper, pp. 1951-1953)
23. (C) Aspirin frequently can precipitate asthma in susceptible individuals. At highest risk are asthmatics with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. This is probably a pseudoallergic reaction related to inhibition of cyclooxygenase with a resultant enhancement of leukotriene synthesis or effect. Densensitization regimens have been developed. (Kasper, p. 1510)
24. (A) Ankylosing spondylitis and HLA B27 (Kasper, pp. 1994-1995)
25. (F) SLE is a multigenic disorder. (Kasper, pp. 1960-1961)
26. (B) Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and HLA DR4 (Kasper, p. 1968)
27. (C) Type I diabetes mellitus and HLA DR3 (Kasper, p. 2156)
28. (A) Reiter syndrome and HLA B27 (Kasper, pp. 1996-1997)
29. (B) RA and HLA DR4 (Kasper, p. 1968)30. (A) Reactive arthritis (e.g., Shigella or Yersinia) and HLA B27 (Kasper, pp. 1996-1997)

The relationship between HLA antigens and diseases is not absolute, but rather one of increased relative risk. The presence of HLA B27 increases the relative risk of ankylosing spondylitis by a factor of about 80 , of Reiter syndrome by a factor of 40 , and also increases the likelihood of reactive arthritis. The presence of HLA DR4 increases the likelihood of juvenile RA by a factor of 7 and RA by a factor of 6 . The presence of HLA DR3 increases the likelihood of both SLE and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by a factor of approximately 3.
31. (A) Multiple myeloma and B-cell deficiency/ dysfunction (Kasper, pp. 656-657)
32. (C) Hodgkin's disease and T-cell deficiency/ dysfunction (Kasper, pp. 654-655)
33. (A) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and B-cell deficiency/dysfunction (Kasper, pp. 648-649)
34. (F) SLE and complement deficiency (Kasper, pp. 1960-1961)
35. (D) Therapy for hematologic malignancy and neutropenia (Kasper, p. 635)
36. (B) Ataxia-telangiectasia and both T- and B-cell dysfunction (Kasper, p. 2423)

Multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are two of the more common causes of B-cell deficiency/dysfunction. Hodgkin's disease, AIDS, sarcoidosis, and thymic aplasia or hypoplasia result in T-lymphocyte depletion/ dysfunction. SLE has been associated with C3 deficiency, but most severe complement deficiencies result from inherited disorders. Ataxiatelangiectasia, common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome have mixed T- and B-cell deficiency.# Diseases of the Respiratory System Questions

Her CXR is abnormal for a large left hilar mass. She has a 30-pack-peryear history of smoking. Biopsy of the mass is positive for a lung cancer most commonly associated with ectopic endocrine syndromes. (SELECT ONE)
62. A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of left shoulder pain radiating down his left arm. His only risk factor for cardiac disease is hypertension and a 30-pack-per-year smoking history. On examination, his blood pressure is $150 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in both arms, pulse $100 / \mathrm{min}$, and heart sounds are normal. He also has ptosis of his left eyelid and a left pupil that is smaller than the right. ECG is normal, and a CXR shows a large left apical mass with 1st and 2nd rib destruction. A biopsy of the mass is consistent with lung cancer most commonly associated with Pancoast's syndrome. (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (C) Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an inflammatory disorder of the lungs involving alveolar walls and terminal airways that is caused by repeated exposure to organic agents. In this example of "farmer's lung," the inhalation of antigens present in moldy hay such as thermophilic actinomyces or Aspergillus species are the causative agents. When exposure to moldy hay is stopped, symptoms and signs of farmer's lung all tend to abate and complete recovery usually follows. In acute syndromes, the presentation is $4-8$ hours after exposure. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, cough, and dyspnea without wheezing. The rate of disease depends on rainfall (which promotes fungal growth) and agricultural practices related to turning and stacking hay. In acute and subacute presentations, removing exposure to the antigen will result in complete recovery. (Kasper, p. 1516)
2. (C) COPD is defined as a disease state that is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are closely related, and the term COPD is often used to encompass both. Chronic bronchitis is a clinical syndrome defined as excessive tracheobronchial mucous production severe enough to cause productive cough for at least 3 months of the year for at least two consecutive years. Emphysema is defined as the distention of air spaces distal to the terminale bronchiole, with destruction of alveolar septa. It is primarily a histologic diagnosis. Smoking is the usual antecedent for COPD. (Kasper, p. 1547)
3. (B) Tranquilizers and sedatives should be avoided in prolonged asthma attacks. Bronchodilators, fluids, aminophylline, and steroids may be used. In acute situations, IV glucocorticoids are frequently used. Results of therapy should be monitored in an objective manner, with peak expiratory flow rates or FEV1. In acute asthmatic attacks, hypocarbia is usual on blood gas analysis. Normal or elevated $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is a bad sign and requires intensive monitoring and aggressive treatment. (Kasper, pp. 1570-1571)
4. (E) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillus usually requires long-term treatment with glucocorticoids. The major diagnostic criteria are bronchial asthma, pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia greater than 1000, immediate wheal and flare response to Aspergillus fumigans, serum precipitins to A. fumigans, elevated serum IgE, and central bronchiectasis. (Kasper, p. 1520)
5. (C) Relatively asymptomatic patients often require no treatment. Steroids are used with ocular (as in this case), CNS, or other serious complications. Although $50 \%$ of patients are left with permanent organ impairment, these are usually not symptomatic or significant. Only in $15-20 \%$ of cases does the disease remain active or recur. Glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice, but numerous other agents have been used. (Kasper, p. 2023)
6. (D) The administration of oxygen may worsen the syndrome of carbon dioxide narcosis because the chief stimulus to ventilation is often hypoxia, and when this is suddenlyrelieved, the ventilation may drop quickly. Causes of the chronic hypoventilation syndrome include impaired respiratory drive (e.g., prolonged hypoxia, central nervous system [CNS] disease), neuromuscular disorders (e.g., motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis), or impaired ventilatory apparatus (e.g., kyphoscoliosis, COPD). (Kasper, p. 1570)
7. (C) The perfusion lung scan is most valuable in ruling out a PE. If properly performed early in the course of symptoms, a normal scan rules out the diagnosis. High-probability scans are usually considered enough evidence of PE to warrant definitive treatment. Intermediate- or low-probability scans may require further investigation (e.g., with pulmonary angiography), depending on the prior probability of disease. More recent data suggest that a normal high-resolution chest CT with contrast rules out clinically significant PE and is replacing perfusion scanning since the lung images may provide an alternate diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. (Kasper, p. 1562)
8. (C) Open lung biopsy is not required. Pulmonary angiography is usually performed only if a lung scan suggests thromboembolic disease. Cardiac catheterization is useful to exclude an underlying cardiac shunt as the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is normal but can be difficult to obtain. (Kasper, p. 1404)
9. (D) Hypoventilation always causes both hypoxemia and hypercapnia. If the hypoventilation syndrome is caused exclusively by impaired respiratory drive (e.g., drug overdose), then the alveolar-arterial $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ gradient remains normal. Often, hypoventilation results from more than one disorder in the respiratory system (e.g., COPD plus metabolic alkalosis secondary to diuretics and glucocorticoids). (Kasper, p. 1569)
10. (C) Chronic bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of 2 successive years in a patient in whom other causes of chronic
cough have been excluded. Emphysema is a pathologic term describing the abnormal permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of their walls without obvious fibrosis. Emphysema may be noted in patients with COPD. (Kasper, p. 1549)
11. (A) In most circumstances, treatment is anticoagulation to prevent further pulmonary emboli. However, hemodynamic instability may warrant primary therapy for the embolus (e.g., thrombolysis). Evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram can be an indication for such primary therapy. (Kasper, p. 1562)
12. (B) Neurogenic tumors are the most common posterior mediastinal masses. Other posterior mediastinal masses include meningoceles, meningomyeloceles, gastroenteric cysts, and esophageal diverticula. Common anterior mediastinal masses include thymomas, lymphomas, teratomas, and thyroid masses. Middle mediastinal masses include vascular lesions, lymph nodes, and pleuropericardial and bronchogenic cysts. (Kasper, p. 1568)
13. (A) Most people have two MM genes and a resultant alpha1-antitrypsin level in excess of $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$. Homozygotes with ZZ or SS genotypes have severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency and develop severe panacinar emphysema in the third or fourth decade of life. Smoking is an important cofactor in the development of disease. Heterozygotes (MZ or MS) have intermediate levels of alpha1-antitrypsin (i.e., genetic expression is that of an autosomal codominant allele). This heterozygous state is common ( $5-14 \%$ of general population), but it is unclear whether it is associated with lung function abnormalities. (Kasper, p. 1551)
14. (A) Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by bilateral upper lobe fibrosis, which may be complicated by fibrocavitary disease. The pulmonary involvement is rare and is usually very slowly progressive. The cavities can be colonized by Aspergillus. (Kasper, p. 1558)15. (D) The natural history of the disease is unclear because the disease is asymptomatic for a long period. Survival from diagnosis is dependent on the functional class of the patient. Functional class IV dyspnea suggests a mean survival of only 6 months. Death is usually the result of either intractable right heart failure or sudden death. (Kasper, p. 1405)
16. (D) The primary pathology is likely to be located in the respiratory center. Cyanosis, especially when asleep, is caused by a combination of polycythemia and hypoxia. The symptoms of alveolar hypoventilation are caused by both hypercarbia and hypoxemia. (Kasper, p. 1570)
17. (A) Antibiotics and postural drainage might be included in therapy. The choice of antimicrobial agents is guided by the sputum culture, but ampicillin and tetracycline are used if normal flora is found. The general principles of therapy include eliminating underlying problems, improved clearance of secretions, control of infections, and reversal of airflow obstruction. (Kasper, p. 1543)
18. (B) A significant portion of asthmatics have no known personal or family history of atopy and have normal IgE levels. Idiosyncratic asthma is more likely to have its onset in adult life. Upper respiratory infections can serve as triggers for idiosyncratic asthma. (Kasper, p. 1508)
19. (A) Acute granulomatous uveitis may be the initial manifestation of sarcoidosis. It can cause blindness. About $25 \%$ of patients with sarcoid have eye involvement-three-quarters have anterior uveitis and one-quarter have posterior uveitis. Involvement of lacrimal glands can lead to dry, sore eyes. (Kasper, p. 2020)
20. (A) Paraneoplastic syndromes are classified as metabolic, neuromuscular, connective tissue, dermatologic, and vascular. Stevens-Johnson syndrome usually follows drug allergy. Acanthosis nigricans and other cutaneous manifestations (e.g., dermatomyositis) are rare $(<1 \%)$. Clubbing is common and occurs in up to $30 \%$ of non-small cell lung cancers. The various
endocrine syndromes occur in $12 \%$ of cases. At times, paraneoplastic syndromes may be the presenting finding in lung cancer or be the first sign of recurrence. Most occur with non-small cell lung cancer, but SIADH is more characteristic of small cell lung cancer. (Kasper, p. 506)
21. (E) Traditionally, penicillin was the treatment of choice for anaerobic lung disease. However, metronidazole plus either third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) or fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) has a better spectrum of activity against oral anaerobes, Gram negatives, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. (Kasper, p. 1535)
22. (D) Carbon dioxide retention is seen in right-toleft shunt only with exercise and is uncommon in impaired diffusion syndromes. Disorders of the chest wall, lower airways, and lungs can cause an increased $\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ because of severe ventilation-perfusion mismatching despite normal or increased minute volume of ventilation. (Kasper, p. 1570)
23. (C) Transbronchial biopsy helps differentiate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) from similar syndromes with specific treatments. These include chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and sarcoidosis. (Kasper, pp. 1556-1557)
24. (A) Bronchography has been superseded by a CT scan in defining the extent of bronchiectasis. Occasionally, advanced cases of saccular bronchiectasis can be diagnosed by routine CXR. The use of high-resolution CT scanning, in which the images are 1.5 mm thick, has resulted in excellent diagnostic accuracy. (Kasper, p. 1542)
25. (D) Patients frequently are subjected to test doses of short-acting vasodilators such as IV prostacyclin or adenosine, or inhaled nitric oxide. About half of these responders will then respond to high oral doses of nifedipine or diltiazem. Prostacyclin is also available as a treatment, but its applicability is limited by the necessity to administer it as a continuous IV infusion. (Kasper, p. 1405)26. (C) The increased vascular permeability is the hallmark of the disease. Diagnostic criteria include acute onset, $\mathrm{PaO}_{2} / \mathrm{FiO}_{2}=200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (regardless of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] level), bilateral infiltrate on frontal CXR, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure $=$ 18 mm Hg (or if not measured, no evidence of left atrial hypertension). (Kasper, p. 1592)
27. (B) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (in asthmatics), parasitic reactions, and drugs are known causes of pulmonary eosinophilia. Idiopathic causes include Löeffler's syndrome (benign, acute eosinophilic pneumonia), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and Churg-Strauss allergic granulomatosis. (Kasper, p. 1520)
28. (E) There is no diagnostic blood test, but twothirds of patients with sarcoidosis will have an elevated level of ACE. Also there is an elevated ESR, hyperglobulinemia, and occasionally hypercalcemia, which are all nonspecific findings. A false-positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) antibodies can also be seen. The gallium scan is positive in patients with sarcoidosis. (Kasper, p. 2022)
29. (B) Yearly influenza vaccination is indicated for patients with COPD. Evidence for pneumococcal vaccination is not definitive but some advocate giving it as well. There is no role for vaccination with $H$. influenzae $B$ or meningococcus in patients with COPD. Dietary support to prevent malnutrition and improve muscle strength can be helpful. Exercise programs seem to provide subjective improvement as well. Obviously, stopping smoking is crucial. (Kasper, p. 1552)
30. (C) Acute mediastinitis is a rare complication of upper endoscopy. It can also result from trauma to the trachea or esophagus, or dissection of the retroperitoneum. Clinical presentation may include substernal chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, and Hamman's signs, a crunching or clicking noise synchronous with the heartbeat. (Kasper, p. 1568)
31. (C) Hemoptysis suggests infection in a patient with advanced lung disease. Pancreatic exocrine function is poor. Nasal polyps are common, but not rectal polyps. About 7\% of cases of cystic fibrosis are diagnosed after age 18. Because of improved therapy, cystic fibrosis is no longer just a pediatric disease. Median survival is now 32 years for men and 29 years for women. (Kasper, p. 1543)
32. (B) Hypoxemia while receiving $100 \%$ oxygen indicates right-to-left shunt. Shunts permit circulation of blood that never passes through the ventilated lung. Shunting can occur within the lung (atelectasis, vascular abnormalities) or outside the lung (congenital cardiac malformations). The hypoxemia of ventilation-perfusion mismatch is more easily correctable by $100 \%$ oxygen. (Kasper, pp. 1503-1504)
33. (C) Bony deformities of the chest can lead to respiratory failure with raised $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, as well as recurrent pulmonary infection. Most patients develop a restrictive lung disease pattern with decreased compliance, reduced TLC and VC. In addition, because of the reduced compliance, the resting position of the lung changes such that FRC is reduced. Finally, the net effect is an increase in the work of breathing. The pattern on pulmonary function testing is usually that of a restrictive pattern. (Kasper, p. 1569)
34. (A) The VC is reduced in emphysema, but the FEV1 is grossly reduced because of high airway resistance. In predominant emphysema, diffusing capacity is more profoundly decreased than in predominant bronchitis. (Kasper, p. 1549)
35. (E) All forms of asbestos fiber have been associated with lung disease. Restrictive, not obstructive, disease is characteristic. Lung cancer, either squamous cell or adenocarcinoma, is the most common malignancy and the risk is greatly increased by smoking. Benign pleural effusions can occur in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reportsof mesothelioma 30-35 years after brief exposure to asbestos emphasize the importance of a complete occupational/environmental history. (Kasper, p. 1522)
36. (A) PE is an important postoperative complication, which requires urgent treatment. This man is hemodynamically stable and treatment consists of anticoagulation to prevent another PE or propagation of the clot. Thrombolytics are not indicated unless there is severe hemodynamic compromise, and especially in him since he has had recent surgery. The efficacy of IV heparin and LMWH is the same, and can be used with caution in the postoperative setting if there is no ongoing bleeding from the operative site. IVC filter would only be indicated if the patient could not be anticoagulated for some absolute contraindication. The thrust of management is therefore prevention. (Kasper, p. 1561)
37. (C) In the preantibiotic era, bacterial bronchopneumonia was the most common cause of bronchiectasis. Now it is felt that influenza and adenoviruses are the most common causes. Of the bacterial causes, S. aureus, Klebsiella, and anaerobes are the most common. Besides infection impaired drainage of the involved segment by bronchial obstruction (foreign body) or poorly functioning cilia is required. Other causes in some individual include poor host humeral immunity such as hypogammaglobulinemia. (Kasper, p. 1542)
38. (B) The description of a middle-aged man with daytime sleepiness, obesity, hypertension, and snoring suggests obstructive sleep apnea. Although nasal continuous positive airway pressure is effective treatment, simple oxygen therapy is not. Stopping sedative medications and avoiding alcohol improves symptoms. Restless sleep and sudden death have been described as part of the syndrome and surgery (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty or tracheostomy) has been used in severe cases. A wide variety of symptoms can occur, but neuropsychiatric and behavioral manifestations secondary to sleep disturbance are the most common. (Kasper, p. 1573)
39. (B) Nocturnal oxygen supplementation improves symptoms but is not as effective as continuous supplementation in prolonging life and decreasing hospitalization. Some symptoms of erythrocytosis, headaches, and fullness can be relieved by phlebotomy. In prolonged air travel, even those with $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ in the mid 70 s should be considered for oxygen therapy. $\mathrm{APO}_{2}$ below 55 mm Hg is an indication for oxygen therapy, but between 55 and 60 mm Hg , associated evidence of right heart dysfunction should also be present before therapy is commenced. (Kasper, p. 1552)
40. (C) In asbestosis, there is moderate pleural thickening, with scalloped margins from apex to base. There is a similar finding in the mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura. Furthermore, there is a plaque of pleural calcification in the base. The association of asbestosis with mesothelioma has long been known. As the neoplasm progresses, it may envelop the thorax. (Kasper, p. 1552)
41. (B) Kartagener's syndrome consists of situs inversus (with dextrocardia), bronchiectasis, and nasal polyps. The bronchiectasis results from impaired ciliary function. (Kasper, p. 1542)
42. (A) The diagnosis is pneumonia. There is consolidation of the left lower lobe. The increased density, presence of air bronchogram, and the silhouetting of the left diaphragm point to a parenchymal lesion. Pneumococcal infection, as in this patient, is still the most common etiology, although other bacterial infections such as Klebsiella, Streptococcus, or, Staphylococcus is often encountered. Viral and arthropod-borne diseases are also seen. (Kasper, p. 1532)
43. (B) There is a calcified nodule in the left apex. Obviously, a calcified tuberculous granuloma is the most common lesion. This may be from reinfection tuberculosis, where its preference for the apicoposterior segment is well-known. It is also possible that it may be a calcified Ghon's lesion. (Kasper, p. 956)
44. (C) Primary pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH), also called eosinophilicgranuloma of the lung, pulmonary Langerhans cell granulomatosis, and pulmonary histiocytosis $X$, is an uncommon interstitial lung disease that primarily affects young adults. There is a coarse, reticular pattern in the whole lung, somewhat more prominent in the upper lobes, suggesting a honeycomb appearance. It is the density here that is abnormal and not the lucency. The next most appropriate test would be a better definition of the lung findings with a high-resolution CT scan. The other more invasive investigations may be more appropriate after the CT. (Kasper, p. 1520)
45. (A) Because of the maintained increase in minute volume and the maintenance of arterial $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$, patients with emphysema are referred to as pink puffers. The relatively high $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ and relatively low hemoglobin, as compared to chronic bronchitis, make cyanosis unusual in emphysema. (Kasper, p. 1551)
46. (C) This history suggests a benign bronchial adenoma. These are usually centrally located on CXR. The most appropriate next test would be a lung CT to demonstrate a lesion. The other tests are invasive and/or not appropriate for identifying the source of bleeding. (Kasper, p. 207)
47. (B) This presentation is characteristic of primary pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is much less common. The predominant pathology, plexogenic arteriopathy, is characterized by medial hypertrophy associated with laminar intimal fibrosis and plexiform lesions. The thrombotic arteriopathy is characterized by eccentric intimal fibrosis with medial hypertrophy, fibroelastic intimal pads in the arteries and arterioles, and evidence of old recanalized thrombi. There is a female predominance, and the third or fourth decade is the most common age at presentation. By the time of diagnosis, the pulmonary hypertension is usually severe. (Kasper, p. 1405)
48. (A) Most lung abscesses and all anaerobic abscesses involve the normal flora of the oropharynx. Septic embolic usually contain S. aureus. Factors that predispose to Gramnegative colonization of the oropharynx
include hospitalization, debility, severe underlying diseases, alcoholism, diabetes, and advanced age. Impaired consciousness, neurologic disease, swallowing disorders, and nasogastric or endotracheal tubes all increase the likelihood of aspiration. (Kasper, p. 1538)
49. (B) Transbronchial biopsy, looking for noncaseating granulomas, is required to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in someone with the right clinical context. The other investigations are supportive of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis but not diagnostic of it, since many other conditions can cause an elevated ACE level or positive gallium scan. (Kasper, p. 2023)
50. (A) A negative D-dimer level rules out thromboembolic disease in patients with intermediate or low pretest probability for DVT/PE. When done by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, it is relatively sensitive (i.e., a negative result helps rule out DVT or PE). When done by the latex agglutination method (qualitative assay), it is neither specific nor sensitive enough to guide therapy. (Kasper, p. 1562)
51. (D) Sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis. Granulomatous inflammatory changes of sarcoidosis may occur in almost any organ. About $90 \%$ of patients with sarcoid will have an abnormal CXR at some point. (Kasper, p. 2022)
52. (A) Bronchiectasis is defined as a permanent abnormal dilatation of large bronchi due to destruction of the wall. It is a consequence of inflammation, usually an infection. Other causes include toxins or immune response. Persistent cough and purulent sputum production are the hallmark symptoms. (Kasper, p. 1542)
53. (D)
54. (B)
55. (A)
56. (C)
57. (E)Careful physical examination can be very useful in diagnosing many common pulmonary disorders. Atelectasis and large pleural effusions both can present with decreased fremitus, dullness or flatness to percussion, and absent breath sounds. In atelectasis, tracheal shift, if present, is toward the affected side, and the opposite for a large pleural effusion. Asthma's most typical manifestations are prolonged expiration and diffuse wheezing. However, impaired expansion, decreased fremitus, hyperresonance, and low diaphragms can also be found. A complete pneumothorax results in absent fremitus, hyperresonance or tympany, and absent breath sounds. Lobar pneumonia is characterized by consolidation with increased fremitus, dullness, and auscultatory findings of bronchial breathing, bronchophony, pectoriloquy, and crackles. (Kasper, p. 1496)
58. (A) Hypercalcemia may be due to metastatic destruction of bone, ectopic formation of parathyroid hormone, or formation of other osteolytic substances. (Kasper, pp. 506-507)
59. (D) Combination chemotherapy has produced promising results in lung cancer, particularly of the small cell anaplastic type. Alkylating agents and anthracyclines are active among other agents. (Kasper, pp. 506-507)
60. (A, B, C, E) Early stage non-small cell lung cancer can be cured by surgery. However, $70 \%$ present with disseminated disease. (Kasper, pp. 506-507)
61. (D) The most commonly encountered syndromes are SIADH, Cushing's syndrome, and gynecomastia. (Kasper, pp. 506-507)
62. (A) Pancoast's syndrome (or superior sulcus syndrome) is found in apical lung tumors, usually epidermoid. Shoulder pain secondary to involvement of the eighth cervical and first and second thoracic nerves is characteristic. Horner syndrome frequently coexists. (Kasper, pp. 506-507)# Clinical Pharmacology Questions

66. A 79-year-old woman complains of dry mouth. She reports no other symptoms and cannot recall the medications she is currently taking. Which of the above may be a factor? (SELECT ONE)# Answers and Explanations 

1. (C) The most common symptomatic side effect in men is impotence, and it should be specifically looked for. The most serious complications relate to fluid and electrolyte imbalance and include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and volume contraction. (Brunton, p. 849)
2. (E) Ranitidine is an H2-blocker that reversibly competes with histamine for binding to H 2 receptors on gastric parietal cells. Its effect is profound on basal acid secretion, but it also has a significant effect on stimulated (e.g., food, hypoglycemia, vagal stimulation) acid production. (Brunton, p. 971)
3. (B) The mediator of hyponatremia is likely antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Although controlling water permeability is the main function under ADH control, there is some evidence that ADH influences sodium transport in the cortical collecting duct. ADH can also act as a neurotransmitter. Autonomic effects of ADH in the CNS include bradycardia, increase in respiratory rate, suppression of fever, and alteration of sleep patterns. (Brunton, pp. 778-779)
4. (B) Methimazole is an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. Methimazole interferes with thyroid function mainly by inhibition of thyroidal organic binding and coupling reactions. In contrast to other agents such as perchlorate, the action of thioamides is not prevented by large doses of iodide. (Brunton, pp. 1527-1528)
5. (B) Nifedipine is a synthetic agent that is a potent, long-acting systemic vasodilator for the treatment of coronary vasospasm. It is also effective for hypertension. At doses used clinically, nifedipine does not block transmission through
the AV node. The vasodilatation can result in a reflex increase in heart rate. (Brunton, pp. 832-834)
6. (C) Polar side chains added to penicillin molecules made these compounds acid stable and, therefore, improved absorption. Intake of food prior to ingestion of ampicillin will decrease absorption. In cases of severe renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted downward. (Brunton, p. 1139)
7. (A) Most of the fluoroquinolones are renally excreted and therefore require dose adjustment in renal failure. Exceptions are moxifloxacin and pefloxacin, which are metabolized by the liver. The other antibiotics do not require any adjustment for renal failure. Ampicillin needs to be adjusted only with severe renal failure. (Brunton, p. 1121)
8. (C) Because of their toxicity, neither drug is widely used in treatment, but both are effective in inhibiting iodide transport. They work by preventing the thyroid gland from concentrating iodide. Thiocyanate is produced following enzymatic hydrolysis of certain plant glycosides (e.g., cabbage), and may be a contributing factor to endemic goiter in certain parts of the world where iodide intake is low. (Brunton, pp. 1530-1531)
9. (D) Beta-blockers are frequently used in the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and for migraine prophylaxis and might prevent aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome. It rarely causes clinical problems in patients with claudication, but if AV conduction defects are present (either by disease or use of other drugs), life-threatening bradyarrhythmias can occur. (Brunton, pp. 287-288)10. (A) Folate deficiency can be secondary to small bowel disease, alcoholism, inadequate intake, disease states with high cell turnover (hemolytic anemia), drugs (methotrexate), and pregnancy. The concentration of folate in plasma changes rapidly with changes in food intake, so the diagnosis of anemia secondary to folate deficiency is made more reliable by measuring red blood cell folate. (Brunton, p. 1460)
11. (D) Vitamin $B_{12}$ absorption is best in the distal ileum. Receptors for the intrinsic factor are present in the distal ileum, but mass action absorption also occurs with large doses. However, the oral route is still felt to be unreliable if hematologic or neurologic effects are present. The Schilling test, with and without intrinsic factor, can help diagnose the exact cause of $B_{12}$ deficiency. (Brunton, pp. 1454-1455)
12. (A) Sympathomimetic effects such as pupillary dilatation, piloerection, hyperthermia, and tachycardia are common in an overdosage of LSD. Other symptoms include dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, nausea, and paresthesias. The hallucinogenic effects can last for hours and are mainly visual. (Brunton, pp. 624-625)
13. (D) GI symptoms are the major side effects of tetracycline. Stomatitis, glossitis, and diarrhea are seen and may be related to superinfections. Hepatic toxicity has been reported but is rare except in massive doses or during pregnancy. Tetracyclines can cause discoloration of teeth in children and in fetuses of mothers given the drug during pregnancy. (Brunton, p. 1178)
14. (D) Thrombocytopenia usually occurs after weeks or months of therapy. It is due to formation of drug-platelet complexes that evoke a circulating antibody. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding can be severe but resolve rapidly on discontinuing the drug. The antibody is longlasting, and reintroduction of quinidine, even in a small dose, can rapidly cause thrombocytopenia. Other hypersensitivity reactions to quinidine include hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, and a lupus syndrome. The most common side effects of quinidine are gastrointestinal and include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. (Brunton, pp. 928-929)
15. (C) Lithium is used primarily for bipolar affective disorder, either to treat mania or prevent recurrences of the bipolar disorder. It has also been used in severe unipolar depression. Acute intoxication can result in vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, ataxia, coma, and convulsions. Leukocytosis is also a side effect of lithium therapy. Polyuria and polydipsia secondary to acquired nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is a common side effect. Both acute and chronic intoxication can be lethal. The toxic and therapeutic levels of lithium are very close, and patients on lithium require close medical observation, including measurement of serum lithium levels. (Brunton, pp. 487-488)
16. (E) The benefit of nitroglycerin is probably due to diminution in cardiac output and work of the heart. Nitroglycerin generally dilates most veins and arteries, and this result in both a decreased preload and a decreased afterload for the heart. This leads to decreased myocardial oxygen requirements. Although coronary artery dilation also occurs, it is probably not as important in relieving anginal pain. (Brunton, pp. 827-828)
17. (C) Allopurinol effectively blocks uric acid production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is indicated in patients with a history of uric acid calculi of the urinary tract. In addition, it is often used in patients with malignancy (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma), particularly when chemotherapy or radiation therapy is being used. (Brunton, pp. 708-709)
18. (E) Heparin must be given parenterally (usually intravenously or subcutaneously) to be active, and its activity is monitored by the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), not the PT. It is safer than oral anticoagulants in pregnancy and does not deplete clotting factors as its mode of action. Rather, it potentiates the effect of antithrombin III on the clotting cascade. It can be neutralized by administration of protamine. Because protamine can cause a bleeding tendency by its own actions, it is used only when bleeding is severe, and in the lowest possible dose. When low-molecular weight-heparin is used, it has a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile which allows for a weight-adjusteddosage without laboratory follow-up. (Brunton, pp. 1471-1474)
19. (C) The most common therapeutic use of cannabis is as an antiemetic during cancer chemotherapy. It might have some analgesic and anticonvulsant properties. Its ability to lower intraocular pressure has not been therapeutically useful in glaucoma. However, all the possible therapeutic effects of cannabis are accompanied by psychoactive effects, which include impaired cognition and perception, prolonged reaction time, and impaired memory and learning. (Brunton, pp. 622-623)
20. (C) In addition to dehydration, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and alkalosis also result from excessive use of furosemide. Loop diuretics such as furosemide act primarily to inhibit electrolyte reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The degree of diuresis is greater than in other classes of diuretics. (Brunton, pp. 752-753)
21. (D) This is likely an outbreak of meningitis secondary to Neisseria meningitidis. The first line of drugs used for treatment of acute disease includes cefixime, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone. For prophylaxis, rifampin is the preferred agent. (Brunton, pp. 1208-1209)
22. (A) Ranitidine blocks histamine-H2 to receptors and is well-absorbed in the small intestine. It decreases all gastric secretion, not just acid, and is helpful in short bowel syndromes, whereas omeprazole is not. (Brunton, pp. 971-972)
23. (D) Furosemide is effective despite gross electrolyte disturbances or hypoalbuminemia. Excretion of large volumes of bicarbonate-poor urine leads to alkalosis, so an acidosis is not a contradiction in severe fluid and electrolyte depletion; a trial in oliguric states is often appropriate. Furosemide is related to sulfonamide, and severe allergic reactions can occur. (Brunton, pp. 752-753)
24. (E) Anthracyclines include daunorubicin and doxorubicin. The major site of metabolism is the
liver, and the mechanism of action includes inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent ribonucleic acid (RNA) metabolism. The cardiomyopathy is characteristic of these drugs and is characterized by arrhythmias and cumulative dose-related CHF. (Brunton, pp. 1358-1359)
25. (B) Ethanol is the standard antidote for methanol. It inhibits the conversion of methanol to its toxic metabolite, formic acid, by alcohol dehydrogenase. (Brunton, pp. 592-593, 599-600)
26. (C) With prolonged treatment, the active N desethyl derivative of amiodarone accumulates in plasma, and its concentration may exceed that of the parent compound. Amiodarone is poorly (approximately 30\%) absorbed and there is marked interindividual variability. The half-life is long, 25-60 days, presumably because it is extensively bound to tissues, resulting in a large volume of distribution and a reservoir of drug. (Brunton, pp. 920-921)
27. (E) Most deaths from barbiturate-induced coma are caused by pulmonary complications (atelectasis, edema, bronchopneumonia) or renal failure. Hypoventilation is characteristic, and only 10 times the full reactive dose can cause severe poisoning. This low toxic-therapeutic ratio is one reason why barbiturate use (hence barbiturate coma) is declining. (Brunton, pp. 414-420)
28. (E) Ketones, glucose amino acids, and fatty acids promote insulin secretion. Stimulation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors inhibits insulin secretion, whereas beta2-adrenergic receptor stimulation enhances release of insulin. As a result, beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonists decrease insulin levels. Activation of the autonomic nervous system (hypoxia, hypothermia, severe burns, surgery) will also suppress insulin secretion. (Brunton, pp. 1615-1616)
29. (D) All the changes listed are correct, but the increased automaticity of the heart with the development of ventricular premature beats (or more serious ventricular arrhythmias) is the most prominent change. (Brunton, pp. 243-245)30. (C) Epinephrine results in a more rapid heart rate and more powerful systolic contraction resulting in increased cardiac output. Norepinephrine results in an unchanged or even decreased cardiac output. (Brunton, pp. 244-248)
31. (C) Both epinephrine and norepinephrine decrease renal blood flow. Epinephrine decreases total peripheral resistance whereas norepinephrine increases total peripheral resistance. Both drugs decrease cutaneous blood flow and only epinephrine increases muscle blood flow. (Brunton, p. 244)
32. (C) The preferential effect of dobutamine on contractility makes it useful in low cardiac output states. Both drugs are very short-acting, can potentiate cardiac ischemia, and affect smooth muscle. Unlike isoproterenol, dobutamine frequently increases blood pressure quite significantly thus requiring dosage adjustment. (Brunton, pp. 250-251)
33. (E) Most of the side effects from the use of betaadrenergic agonists in asthma come from stimulation of the beta1-receptors in the heart. Thus, beta2-selective agonists, which act primarily in the lung, are safer to use. Both selective and nonselective beta-agonists will decrease airway resistance. This is their major therapeutic effect. The effects on mucociliary transit, mast cells, and microvascular permeability occur with both nonselective and selective agonists, but the clinical importance of these effects is unclear. (Brunton, pp. 251-253)
34. (C) It is felt that innate tolerance is a polygenic characteristic. Frequently, variation in pharmacokinetic variables (absorption, metabolism, excretion), which can be inherited, are the cause of different levels of innate tolerance. Those who have high levels of innate tolerance are more likely to become addicted to alcohol. There is a higher concordance rate for alcoholism among identical twins than fraternal twins, but it is not $100 \%$. (Brunton, pp. 601-602)
35. (D) The most common cause of pharmacokinetic tolerance is an increase in the metabolism
of the drug. Since these same enzymes can then metabolize other drugs, this kind of tolerance is not necessarily specific to the drug that induced it. (Brunton, pp. 609-611)
36. (C) Learned tolerance refers to the reduction of the effect of a drug due to compensatory mechanisms that are learned. An example is walking a straight line despite the motor impairment caused by alcohol. This likely represents both acquisition of motor skills and the learned awareness of one's deficit; thus the person walks more carefully. (Brunton, p. 610)
37. (D) Sensitization is the reverse of tolerance. It refers to an increase in effect of the drug with repetition of the same dose. It does not occur during an acute binge. The dose response curve would be shifted to the left. (Brunton, p. 611)
38. (B) Cocaine and amphetamines are the drugs most likely to cause sensitization. It is poorly studied in humans, but it is thought that stimulant psychosis results from sensitization after prolonged use. (Brunton, p. 611)
39. (B) Almost one-third of people who have tried tobacco become addicted. In comparison, about $15 \%$ become addicted to alcohol. Heroin is also highly addictive ( $23 \%$ of users become addicted), but since so few people even try heroin, the addiction rate in society as a whole is quite low $(0.4 \%)$. (Brunton, pp. 608-609)
40. (E) Muscle cramps, anxiety, insomnia, and dizziness are among the common side effects of withdrawal from moderate dose usage. Withdrawal seizures and delirium occur usually in withdrawal from high dosage. Withdrawal should be done gradually, often over many months. (Brunton, pp. 614-615)
41. (D) Craving for opioids, restlessness, irritability, and anxiety are common symptoms of heroin withdrawal. Piloerection, pupillary dilatation, sweating, tachycardia, and blood pressure elevation are frequently seen signs of heroin withdrawal. It starts within 6-12 hours of the last dose and is quite unpleasant, but not life-threatening. (Brunton, pp. 618-619)42. (C) Meperidine has a half-life of 3 hours, but it has an active metabolite, normeperidine, which has a half-life of 15-20 hours. Therefore, accumulation of normeperidine with toxicity is common. The drug should not be used for prolonged periods (over 48 hours), and probably should not be used at all in those susceptible to delirium (e.g., the elderly). (Brunton, p. 570)
43. (C) Morphine releases histamine and can cause cardiovascular instability. Fentanyl does not release histamine, and causes only mild decreases in heart rate and blood pressure. Fentanyl, a lipid-soluble drug, has an elimination half-life between 3 and 4 hours. It is 100 times more potent than morphine. (Brunton, p. 571)
44. (A) Although doctors seldom prescribe antacids because of the availability of superior medications, patients still use them extensively. As well as neutralizing acid, calcium carbonate enhances secretion in the stomach. The release of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from bicarbonate can result in belching, nausea, and abdominal distension. Belching can exacerbate gastroesophageal reflex. (Brunton, pp. 974-975)
45. (F) Ranitidine inhibits acid production by reversibly competing with histamine for binding to H 2 receptors on parietal cells. Ranitidine's most prominent effect is on basal acid secretion, but it still significantly suppresses stimulated (feeding, gastrin, etc.) acid production. (Brunton, pp. 971-972)
46. (G) After the mucosa is damaged by acid, further damage is caused by pepsin-mediated hydrolysis of mucosal proteins. Sucralfate, in an acid environment, forms a sticky protective gel over epithelial tissues and ulcer craters to prevent further damage by pepsin. This viscous layer can inhibit absorption of many drugs, so patients should wait for at least 2 hours after taking other medications before taking sucralfate. (Brunton, pp. 973-974)
47. (E) Prostaglandins have two effects on gastric mucosa: they inhibit acid secretion by binding to
the EP3 receptor on parietal cells, and they have a cytoprotective effect by stimulating mucin and bicarbonate secretion and local mucosal blood flow. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin analogue, and has both an acid suppression and cytoprotective effect. (Brunton, p. 973)
48. (I) Omeprazole is a potent suppressor of acid secretion by the parietal cell. It inhibits the H , K-ATPase pump (proton pump) and reduces daily basal and stimulated acid secretion by $80-95 \%$. Proton pump blockers are part of the regimen for the eradication of $H$. pylori. (Brunton, pp. 969-970)
49. (E) In chronically poisoned patients, neurologic symptoms and evidence of liver damage may develop. Many industrial solvents are chlorinated hydrocarbons and have been implicated in several deaths. Carbon tetrachloride was once used widely for medical purposes and as a cleaning agent. It has been replaced by safer alternatives. Hepatotoxicity of these compounds is exacerbated by concurrent ethanol ingestion. In lethal cases, death is usually due to deep narcosis, aspiration of vomitus, or cardiac arrhythmias. (Brunton, pp. 625-626)
50. (C) Salicylates are associated with vertigo, hyperventilation, tinnitus, and deafness. Excretion of salicylates is renal, and in the presence of normal renal function, about $50 \%$ will be excreted in 24 hours. Severe toxicity can cause severe acid-base abnormalities. It can be difficult to diagnose when the toxicity is secondary to a therapeutic regimen. (Brunton, pp. 691-692)
51. (A) Cyanide is contained in silver polish, insecticides, rodenticides, and some plants. Inhalation of hydrogen cyanide may cause death within a minute; oral doses act more slowly, requiring several minutes to hours. Cyanide combines with cytochromes and catalase to produce tissue asphyxia. The treatment for cyanide poisoning includes the administration of IV sodium thiosulfate, which hastens the transformation of the cyanide to thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. (Brunton, p. 885)52. (D) Benzene is associated with bone marrow depression. Benzene is present to some extent in most gasolines, and poisoning may result from ingestion or vapors. Acute benzene poisoning can cause severe CNS symptoms such as blurred vision, tremors, shallow and rapid respiration, ventricular irregularities, paralysis, and loss of consciousness. (Brunton, pp. 625-626)
53. (F) Ethylene glycol is widely used as antifreeze. It causes CNS depression and renal toxicity characterized by oxalate crystals in the tubules. As in methanol poisoning, ethanol is used as a competitive substance for alcohol dehydrogenase to decrease the rate of formation of toxic metabolites. (Brunton, pp. 599-600)
54. (K) Digitalis and verapamil decrease the refractoriness of the accessory pathways in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) and the ventricular rate can exceed $300 / \mathrm{min}$. This can be life-threatening and is treated with IV procainamide or cardioversion. (Kasper, pp. 1350-1351)
55. (I) Numerous cardiac and noncardiac medications can cause torsades de pointes. Although it has been described with amiodarone, this is quite rare. The arrhythmia can result in sudden death. Unstable forms of this arrhythmia are treated with cardioversion. (Kasper, p. 1353)
56. (B) MAT usually occurs in the setting of advanced lung disease. Treatment involves withdrawing theophylline and improving lung function. There may be some role for treatment with verapamil. (Kasper, p. 1350)
57. (E) Adenosine is the agent of first choice for the termination of $A V$ nodal or $A V$ reentrant tachycardias that are not terminated by vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage. IV beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are second choice. Digitalis IV acts too slowly and is not recommended for this type of arrhythmia. (Kasper, pp. 1347-1349)
58. (C, G, L) Melphalan is an alkylating agent of the nitrogen mustard type. Although not curative therapy, it is particularly useful in the
management of multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. (Brunton, p. 1328)
59. (B, G, J) Methotrexate is classified as an antimetabolite, and is a folic acid analogue. Other tumors where methotrexate has an effect include osteogenic sarcoma, mycosis fungoides, and lung cancer. (Brunton, pp. 1338-1339)
60. (A) Bleomycin, a naturally occurring antibiotic, is useful in Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and cancers of the testes, head and neck, skin, esophagus, lungs, and genitourinary tract. (Brunton, pp. 1361-1362)
61. (K) Flutamide is an antiandrogen that is useful in prostate cancer. Leuprolide, a gonadotropinreleasing hormone analogue, and various estrogen compounds are the other hormonal-type agents used in prostate cancer therapy. (Brunton, p. 1388)
62. (C, G) Sensory loss is not a side effect of phenothiazines. Parkinson-like symptoms disappear when phenothiazine is withdrawn. Dystonic movements involve the mouth, tongue, and shoulder girdle. As well as having useful antipsychotic effects, phenothiazines are useful as antiemetics and antinausea agents. They can also potentiate the effects of sedatives, analgesics, and general anesthetics. Some phenothiazines are intrinsically sedating, but none of them commonly interfere with sleep. (Brunton, pp. 477-480)
63. (B, F) The increased refractory period accounts for the effect on tachycardia. Similar effects are seen with procainamide. The slowed repolarization can result in a prolonged QT interval. Life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (torsades de pointes) can be provoked by quinidine. It is rarely used in modern practice. (Brunton, pp. 928-929)
64. (A, D) In susceptible individuals, the beta2adrenergic blocking effect of propranolol can cause life-threatening bronchoconstriction. Ephedrine, isoproterenol, and albuterol are betaadrenergic agonists and cause bronchodilatation.Ipratropium bromide results in bronchodilatation by its anticholinergic effect. The other medications listed have no effect on bronchial airways. (Brunton, pp. 195, 719-720)
65. (B, F) Caffeine and other methylxanthines also stimulate acid production. Vagal cholinergic stimulation is a major stimulus for gastric secretion. Alcohol may increase secretion by
stimulating gastrin and histamine release. (Brunton, pp. 727-728)
66. (C) Xerostomia (dry mouth) can result from the anticholinergic side effects of taking amitriptyline. The other medications on the list are not usually known to cause a dry mouth. (Brunton, pp. 446-447)This page intentionally left blank# Comprehensive Review Questions

(D) impaired attention
(E) fluctuating performance
116. A77-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his granddaughter for evaluation of confusion. He has no focal findings and his neuro-imaging studies are normal. Further investigations reveal a urinary tract infection, and the man improves somewhat after treatment, but still exhibits poor judgment and bizarre behavior. Pressing the family for information, the intern unearths a history of 8 years of progressive bizarre behavior.

(A) microangiopathic changes
(B) lacunar infarcts
(C) diffuse Lewy bodies
(D) pigmentary degeneration
(E) neurofibrillary tangles# Answers and Explanations 

1. (A) This patient has gonorrhea, and since 1986, increasing penicillin resistance has meant that penicillin/ampicillin are no longer drugs of choice. Alternatives to ceftriaxone include ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or cefixime given orally, with 7 days of doxycycline, or a single 1 g dose of azithromycin in case of coinfection with Chlamydia. In Asia and the Pacific (as well as in California), quinolones are not considered first-line therapy because of the high rate of resistant organisms. In these locations, ceftriaxone is the drug of choice. In pregnant women, erythromycin replaces doxycycline. Disseminated gonococcal infection should be treated in a hospital with IV antibiotics. (Kasper, $p p .860-862)$
2. (C) The impaired physiologic reserve of every organ system is characteristic of aging. The term homeostenosis has been used to describe this phenomenon. Decline in most systems starts in the third decade and is gradual and progressive. Decrements in each organ system seem independent of other systems and are influenced by diet, environment, personal habits (e.g., exercise), and genetic factors, as well as just chronologic age. At times, it can be difficult to differentiate between age-related physiologic change and age-related diseases. (Kasper, pp. 44-45)
3. (C) Other tests to rule out reversible disease might include serum electrolytes, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ levels, CBC, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), and CT or MRI. Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. However, the insidious and subtle onset, with few focal signs (except for higher
mental functioning) and a slowly progressive course are characteristic. Careful attention to the pattern of cognitive defects also improves diagnostic accuracy. The intensity of investigation will depend on numerous factors, including age, presence of atypical findings, and the timing of presentation. There is as yet no definite consensus on the most appropriate plan of investigation. (Kasper, pp. 2397-2398)
4. (D) This patient has hyperthyroidism. Cardiac complications are more common in the elderly patient and may dominate the clinical presentation. There is often a wide pulse pressure, systolic murmurs, increased intensity of the first heart sound, and cardiomegaly. Sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation are the most common arrhythmias. A to-and-fro highpitched sound in the pulmonic area (MeansLerman scratch) can mimic a pericardial friction rub. (Kasper, p. 1423)
5. (B) A whole host of locally produced hormones and cytokines, as well as ectopically produced hormones, are implicated in local osteoclastic hypercalcemia. Parathormone-related protein is often elevated in malignant hypercalcemia (with or without bony metastases), but ectopic PTH production in malignancy is quite rare. (Kasper, pp. 561-562)
6. (C) Sarcoidosis presents as an asymptomatic CXR in at least 10-20\% of cases in the United States, but more frequently in countries where pre-employment CXRs are mandatory. At least $40 \%$ of patients present with acute symptoms and hilar lymphadenopathy. Approximately $90 \%$ will have an abnormal CXR at some pointin their illness. Only a small proportion develops progressive disease. (Kasper, pp. 2019-2022)
7. (C) PET scans use glucose analogues to demonstrate metabolic activity. They are rarely available, however, and functional MRI scans are now being used extensively to assess areas of brain activity. (Kasper, p. 2355)
8. (D) Streptococcus group A can cause a toxic shock-like syndrome, and has been increasing in frequency in North America. Streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome was so named because of its similarity to staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The illness includes fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and the respiratory distress syndrome. It is usually caused by strains that produce exotoxin. It may be associated with localized infection as well; the most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection such as necrotizing fasciitis. The mortality is high (up to $30 \%$ ), usually secondary to shock and respiratory failure. The rapid progression of the disease and its high mortality demand early recognition and aggressive treatment. Management includes fluid resuscitation, pressor agents, mechanical ventilation, antibodies, and, if necrotizing fasciitis is present, surgical débridement. (Kasper, pp. 827-828)
9. (D) Diazoxide acts immediately in malignant hypertension and is the easiest to administer for no individual titration of dosage is required. Nitroprusside is more effective, but requires an IV infusion. Labetalol is also useful but has more contraindications. It is particularly useful in the setting of angina or myocardial infarction. Regardless of which drug is selected, early administration of medications for long-term control is mandatory. (Kasper, p. 1480)
10. (D) This man has primary hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia induces a tubular concentrating defect by interfering with ADHmediated water pore function (aquaporin-2 channel) on distal tubular cells. This results in the polyuria and polydipsia symptoms of diabetes insipidus. Chronic hypercalcemia can also cause renal stones, type 1 (distal) RTA and
chronic renal failure but these effects are not directly responsible for the polyuria. PTH has no direct effect on the concentrating ability of the distal tubule. (Kasper, pp. 1694-1701)
11. (E) Ethosuximide and valproic acid are common medications used to treat petit mal epilepsy. Side effects of ethosuximide include GI irritation, skin rash, and bone marrow suppression. (Kasper, p. 2367)
12. (B) Hairy cell leukemia is a B-cell malignancy. Burkitt's lymphoma is of T-cell origin $5 \%$ of the time. CLL can be of T- or B-cell origin. Mycosis fungoides and angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy are of T-cell origin. (Kasper, p. 642)
13. (C) The current case definition of AIDS in a patient with HIV infection is done by symptoms and $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T-lymphocyte cell count. Any category C symptoms (e.g., cervical cancer, mycobacterium avium infection, CMV, retinitis, Kaposi sarcoma, etc.) indicates frank AIDS as does a CD4 ${ }^{+}$T-cell count $<200 / \mu \mathrm{L}$ regardless of symptoms. Shingles and thrush are category B symptoms. (Kasper, p. 1076)
14. (D) Rectal bleeding is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis, as is malignancy with longstanding disease, but both can occur in regional enteritis. Transmural involvement, lymph node involvement, skip lesions, granulomas, and anorectal complications (abscesses, fistulas, fissures) are characteristic of Crohn's disease. (Kasper, pp. 1778-1779)
15. (B) Sudden onset of unexplained dyspnea is the most common and often the only symptom of pulmonary embolism. Findings on physical examination may be deceptively normal, but tachycardia is a consistent finding. Pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis suggest a peripheral embolism adjacent to the pleura. (Kasper, p. 1561)
16. (A) The patient has Wernicke's encephalopathy and requires treatment with thiamine. A delay of a few hours may permit progression to psychosis. The eye findings in Wernicke'sencephalopathy include bilateral (but not necessarily symmetrical) abductor weakness or paralysis, horizontal diplopia, strabismus, and nystagmus. The nystagmus is most frequently horizontal or vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus. (Kasper, p. 1636)
17. (E) Calcitonin is secreted by cells in the thyroid. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and increases renal calcium clearance. The inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and the stimulation of renal calcium clearance are mediated by receptors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Other receptors to calcitonin are present in the brain, GI tract, and immune system. (Kasper, p. 2251)
18. (C) Major manifestations of rheumatic fever include carditis, migratory polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. Minor manifestations include arthralgia, fever, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, C-reactive protein), and prolonged PR interval. The diagnosis is made with two major or one major and two minor criteria, and evidence of group A streptococcal infection (positive throat culture or rapid streptococcal antigen test, or rising antibody titers). (Kasper, p. 1978)
19. (C) Home parenteral nutrition is usually helpful in extreme short-bowel syndrome, chronic obstruction due to adhesions, and severe radiation enteritis. Placement of a central venous catheter, careful calculation of fluid and nutritional requirements, and meticulous monitoring are required in a long-term parenteral nutrition program. (Kasper, p. 418)
20. (A) In selecting a heart for transplantation, size, ABO match, negative lymphocyte cross-match, and other disease states are important factors. The presence of severe pulmonary hypertension can result in intraoperative death. In the United States, it is estimated that only 2000 potential donor hearts become available each year for 20,000 potential recipients. This means that careful recipient selection is very important. The optimal candidates will have a high likelihood of return to a high level of function,
to be mentally vigorous and medically compliant. (Kasper, pp. 1378-1379)
21. (D) CLL is frequently discovered on routine evaluation of elderly patients and may not require treatment for several years. Splenomegaly, when present, rarely leads to symptoms. It is usually a disorder of B cells and is very indolent in its course. Most therapeutic regimens are designed for symptom control, not cure. Common reasons for treatment include hemolytic anemia, cytopenias, disfiguring lymphadenopathy, symptomatic organomegaly, or systemic symptoms. Chlorambucil is easy to administer, but fludarabine is considerably more effective. It requires IV administration. Maintenance therapy is not helpful. (Kasper, pp. 648-649)
22. (D) GI bleeding is the most common precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy. Furosemide, by causing hypokalemia, is another common cause. Narcotics and sedatives are also frequently implicated. (Kasper, pp. 1867-1868)
23. (C) Other causes of asymptomatic hematuria, with or without proteinuria, include sickle cell disease, Alport's syndrome, resolving glomerulonephritis, and thin basement disease. Berger's disease is characterized by immunoglobulin A (IgA) deposits in the mesangium. It most commonly affects older children and young adults, and is more common in Blacks than Whites. Macroscopic hematuria may occur with intercurrent illness or vigorous exercise. The prognosis is variable but tends to progress slowly. Spontaneous remissions are more common in children than in adults. About $20-50 \%$ of patients develop end-stage renal disease within 20 years of diagnosis. (Kasper, p. 1690)
24. (E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to emphysema usually demonstrates severe dyspnea, scanty mucoid sputum, normal hematocrit, and decreased diffusing capacity on pulmonary function testing. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by milder dyspnea, greater sputum production, more frequent hypercarbia and polycythemia, andmore evidence of cor pulmonale and pulmonary hypertension. (Kasper, p. 1551)
25. (E) Muscle weakness in RA is common and can occur within weeks of onset of RA. It is most apparent in muscles adjacent to involved joints. There is not usually a vasculitis present, although a mononuclear infiltrate may be present. The most common finding on biopsy is type II fiber atrophy and muscle fiber necrosis. (Kasper, pp. 1970-1971)
26. (A) Alpha-thalassemia involves a decrease in alpha-chain production and leads to the formation of beta-globin tetramers known as hemoglobin H. Individuals normally inherit four alpha-chain genes. The clinical syndrome depends on how many genes are deleted. Deletion of one gene results in a silent carrier state. Deletion of all four is the most severe and presents as hydrops fetalis. This condition is incompatible with life. (Kasper, p. 599)
27. (A) Diabetic neuropathy usually presents as peripheral polyneuropathy, usually bilateral, including symptoms of numbness, paresthesia, severe hyperesthesia, and pain. Impairment of proprioceptive fibers can lead to gait abnormalities and Charcot's joints. Mononeuropathy is less common and is often spontaneously reversible. Common syndromes include wrist or foot drop and third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsies. Autonomic neuropathy may cause gastroesophageal dysfunction, bladder dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension. (Kasper, pp. 2165-2166)
28. (D) Uricosuric drugs and allopurinol have no role in the treatment of acute gouty arthritis. Salicylates are also not used in the treatment of gout. The treatments of choice are colchicine, NSAIDs, and intra-articular steroid injection. Response is best when initiated early in the disease. Colchicine can be given intravenously to avoid GI distress. A short course of systemic corticosteroids is also quite effective therapy. Allopurinol is started only when all inflammation is gone and colchicine prophylaxis has been started. It is not always required. (Kasper, pp. 2046-2047)
29. (B) The two broad categories of ischemic stroke are embolic and thrombotic. Emboli can originate from an arterial atheroma (e.g., common carotid bifurcation) or from the heart. In the latter case, anticoagulants are often indicated. On occasion, emboli occur without obvious source (e.g., hypercoagulable states, malignancy, eclampsia). (Kasper, pp. 2375-2376)
30. (C) Screening for antibodies to hepatitis $C$ has reduced the incidence of this infection, but numerous chronic cases remain. Treatment options include interferon and ribavirin. The hepatitis $C$ virus is a linear, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. There are at least six distinct genotypes. (Kasper, pp. 666-667)
31. (E) Causes of acute glomerulonephritis include infectious diseases, especially Streptococcus, vasculitides, and primary glomerular disease. The acute nephritic syndrome consists of the abrupt onset of hematuria and proteinuria, often accompanied by azotemia and renal salt and water retention. Oliguria may be present. (Kasper, pp. 1679-1680)
32. (A) The pain may be described as sharp, burning, or gnawing, usually 90 minutes to 3 hours after eating, relieved by food or antacids. The pain frequently awakens the patient at night. Symptoms are usually episodic and recurrent. Periods of remission are usually longer than periods with pain. The ulcer crater can recur or persist in the absence of pain. Only a minority of patients with dyspepsia are found to have an ulcer on endoscopy. (Kasper, pp. 1751-1752)
33. (C) Intravascular hemolysis from blood transfusion is usually due to ABO incompatibility, often from human error. Symptoms of intravascular hemolysis include flushing, pain at the infusion site, chest or back pain, restlessness, anxiety, nausea, and diarrhea. Signs include fever and chills, shock, and renal failure. In comatose patients, hemoglobulinuria or bleeding from disseminated intravascular coagulation can be the first sign. Management is supportive. Acute hemolysis can also result from antibodies directed against other RBCantigens such as Rh, Kell, or Duffy. (Kasper, pp. $665-666)$
34. (D) Radioactive iodine is contraindicated both in scanning and treatment as it damages the fetal thyroid. Propylthiouracil crosses the placenta, but is safe and effective in pregnancy. The lowest effective dose should be used. Hyperthyroidism is hardest to control in the first trimester and easiest in the third trimester. (Kasper, pp. 35-36, 2116)
35. (D) Antihistamine side effects (sedation) and anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary hesitancy, blurred vision) are the most common side effects. Orthostasis is probably the most common serious side effect and is difficult to manage. Severe cardiac toxicity is uncommon and diarrhea and weight loss are associated with SSRI antidepressants. (Kasper, pp. 2554-2555)
36. (B) The most common pathogenic mechanism is thought to be excessive or redundant mitral leaflet tissue, with the posterior leaflet more commonly involved. Myxomatous degeneration can also be seen on pathologic examination. Reassurance regarding the benign nature of the disease is the mainstay of management. When a murmur is present, antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis is warranted. (Kasper, pp. 1395-1396)
37. (B) Little or no changes are seen on light microscopy in this syndrome. The disease is most common in children. Spontaneous remission is common in children and is enhanced by steroid therapy. Over $95 \%$ of children achieve remission within 8 weeks of institution of prednisone therapy. Therefore, in children with nephrotic syndrome, empiric therapy is frequently employed, rather than initial renal biopsy. Only $50 \%$ of adults will remit, and thus biopsy is more frequently required. Relapse is common in both children and adults. (Kasper, p. 1685)
38. (D) Over $90 \%$ of lesions can be localized by fiberoptic bronchoscope in the sedated, but awake, patient and collection of a series of
differential brushings and biopsies. When lesions are found, conservative resection is usually performed. Five-year cure rates in such lesions approach $60 \%$, but second primaries are common ( $5 \%$ per patient per year). There is no evidence that screening programs based on sputum examination will decrease mortality. (Kasper, p. 509)
39. (A) The drop in systolic pressure with inspiration is an important clue to cardiac tamponade, called paradoxical pulse. When severe, the arterial pulse may weaken on palpation during inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus is uncommon in constrictive pericarditis and rare in restrictive cardiomyopathy. It is commonly found in severe asthma as well. (Kasper, pp. 1415-1417)
40. (C) Cyclosporine A blocks production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by helper-inducer (CD4 ${ }^{+}$) T cells. It works alone but is more effective in combination with glucocorticoids. The use of cyclosporine has improved 1-year cadaveric survival rates to the $80-85 \%$ range. Side effects include hepatotoxicity, hirsutism, tremor, and gingival hyperplasia, but only the nephrotoxicity presents a serious management problem. (Kasper, pp. 1670-1671)
41. (E) Typically, multiple sclerosis presents with optic neuritis. There is usually a history of at least two episodes of neurologic deficit at more than one site. Other common presenting symptoms include weakness, sensory loss, and paresthesias. (Kasper, pp. 2462-2463)
42. (E) This patient has HSP; other symptoms include arthralgia and GI function abnormalities. Renal biopsy shows immunoglobulin deposits. There is an underlying vasculitis. The prognosis is generally good, although relapses can occur before the final remission. (Kasper, pp. 2010-2011)
43. (B) Amiodarone causes a decrease in the sinus rate and an increase in the effective refractory period in the atrium, the AV node, and the ventricle. The pharmacology of amiodarone is complex and incompletely understood. (Kasper, pp. 1346-1348)44. (A) Estrogen therapy may retard demineralization of the skeleton and may also reduce blood and urinary calcium levels. However, there is insufficient evidence for a formal recommendation. There is no clear consensus on when asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism requires surgery. Many experts will elect to follow elderly patients with mild hyperparathyroidism who are asymptomatic and have normal renal function and bone mass. (Kasper, pp. 2254-2255)
45. (D) Other drugs, besides antimalarials, that precipitate hemolysis in G6PD deficiency include dapsone, phenacetin, doxorubicin, and nalidixic acid. The disease is sex-linked and thus most common in males. About $11 \%$ of people of African descent have an abnormal allele. Female heterozygotes have a dual population of red cells and, depending on the proportion, may develop symptoms. During hemolysis, older red cells with the lowest enzyme levels are destroyed, and diagnostic tests done at this time may be falsely normal. They should be repeated some time after the hemolysis has resolved. (Kasper, pp. 610-611)
46. (C) Levofloxacin would be effective for most strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and other likely pathogens. Other commonly used drugs for communityacquired pneumonia are amoxicillin, cefuroxime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline. Theoretically, empiric therapy should be guided by knowledge of local resistance patterns. (Kasper, pp. 1534-1535)
47. (C) Other clues to renal tubule defects include electrolyte disorders, renal osteodystrophy, large kidneys, and proteinuria. Categories of tubulointerstitial kidney disease include toxins (exogenous and metabolic), neoplasia, immune diseases, vascular disorders, infections, and hereditary renal diseases. Defects in urinary acidification and concentrating ability are frequently the most troublesome manifestations of tubulointerstitial kidney disease. (Kasper, pp. $1694-1698$ )
48. (E) Proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole and lansoprazole) are the most effective treatments for ulcerative esophagitis. Antacids, sucralfate, and H2-blockers are all useful in less severe reflux disease. (Kasper, pp. 1742-1743)
49. (A) MGUS is vastly more common than multiple myeloma, occurring in $1 \%$ of the population over age 50. Patients with MGUS have smaller M components (usually $<20 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ); no urinary Bence Jones protein; $<5 \%$ marrow plasmacytosis; and no anemia, renal failure, lytic bone lesions, or hypercalcemia. About $25 \%$ of patients with MGUS will go on to develop multiple myeloma. (Kasper, pp. 658-659)
50. (E) Sjögren's syndrome is an immunologic disorder characterized by progressive destruction of the exocrine glands leading to mucosal dryness. Pathology reveals lymphocytic infiltration. About one-third develop systemic (nonglandular) symptoms. The most common systemic manifestation is arthritis or arthralgia. If vasculitis occurs, purpura, urticaria, skin ulcers, and mononeuropathy are its most common manifestations. (Kasper, pp. 1991-1992)
51. (D) The type O donor may contain sufficient anti-A or anti-B to destroy some of the patient's RBCs, but this is seldom clinically significant. Generally, however, crystalloid or colloid solutions are sufficient for volume replacement until properly matched blood is available. (Kasper, pp. 662-663)
52. (D) Other early changes in mitral stenosis include prominence of the main pulmonary arteries and backward displacement of the esophagus. CXR changes are caused by enlargement of the left atrium. Severe disease can cause pulmonary congestion (Kerley B lines) and enlargement of the right ventricle, right atrium, and superior vena cava. (Kasper, pp. 1391-1392)
53. (A) The distribution of muscle weakness is characteristic with early involvement of the cranial nerves, especially the lids and extraocular muscles. Women are more frequently affected than men (3:2 ratio), and the age forpeak incidence in women is in the third or fourth decade. (Kasper, pp. 2518-2519)
54. (E) History of one breast cancer is a risk factor for a second tumor. Risk of breast cancer is increased in women with a family history, early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity, and late age at first pregnancy. Obesity, alcohol, and dietary fat are other possible risk factors. (Kasper, p. 517)
55. (D) Patients with minimal or absent GI symptoms and atypical respiratory symptoms may be diagnosed as adults. This accounts for $7 \%$ of cases. Moreover, because of modern therapy, about $36 \%$ of CF patients in the United States are over 18 years of age, and $12 \%$ are over 30. (Kasper, pp. 1544-1545)
56. (B) Signs of benignity of a solitary pulmonary nodule are lack of growth over a prolonged period and certain patterns of calcification. "Popcorn" calcification does suggest a benign hamartoma. A search for previous CXRs can provide a definitive diagnosis. In nonsmokers under age $35,>1 \%$ of solitary pulmonary nodules are malignant. (Kasper, pp. 512-513)
57. (B) A period of 24-48 hours is usually allowed to attempt medical therapy. Cardiac catheterization and angiography may be followed by bypass surgery or angioplasty. For those who do settle down, some form of subsequent risk stratification (e.g., exercise ECG) is indicated. (Kasper, pp. 1446-1448)
58. (A) Glucocorticoids are not bronchodilators, and their major use is in reducing airway inflammation. It is difficult to provide precise recommendations for their use, and a wide range of systemic and inhaled doses are used. (Kasper, pp. 1513-1514)
59. (C) Immunofluorescence is usually negative. By electron microscopy, focal basement membrane collapse and denudation of epithelial surfaces are noted. The course is generally progressive in adults. It is believed that remission of proteinuria with steroid therapy will improve the prognosis. Cytotoxic drugs and
cyclosporine have also been used in treatment. The degree of proteinuria correlates with the likelihood of developing renal failure. The disease recurs rapidly in transplanted kidneys, suggesting a humoral factor in pathogenesis. (Kasper, pp. 1686-1687)
60. (E) Heartburn is a characteristic symptom of reflux esophagitis and may be associated with regurgitation. Odynophagia and atypical chest pain also occur in esophageal disease. (Kasper, p. 1739)
61. (D) Surgical sympathectomy usually provides only temporary improvement and does not prevent progression of the vascular lesion. Nifedipine is now the drug of choice for treating symptoms not responding to local warming measures (gloves, mitts) and avoidance of smoking and cold. Reserpine, alphamethyldopa, and prazosin may also be useful. (Kasper, p. 1490)
62. (C) The most common presentation is with pain in a weight-bearing joint such as the hip, knee, or ankle. Hematuria is also common. Bleeding can occur at almost any site without prior trauma. (Kasper, pp. 680-681)
63. (B) The principal symptom is the pain of acute pericarditis that usually develops 1-4 weeks following the cardiac surgery but could appear after months. It can also occur after myocardial infarction (Dressler's syndrome) or after trauma to the heart (stab wound, blunt trauma). The syndrome can remit and recur for up to 2 years. The acute symptoms usually subside in 1-2 weeks. (Kasper, pp. 1417-1418)
64. (A) Blind loop syndrome leads to megaloblastic anemia and macrocytosis because of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. The deficiency is caused by colonization with bacteria that takes up ingested cobalamin before it can be absorbed. The other conditions generally cause microcytic or normocytic anemias. (Kasper, pp. 601-604)
65. (A) The patient has Cushing's syndrome secondary to an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumor. Relativelyfew of such patients have a large pituitary tumor that affects the visual pathways. Over $50 \%$ have a microadenoma, which is under 5 mm in diameter. (Kasper, pp. 2135-2136)
66. (E) Elevated triglycerides are the most common dyslipidemia in DM. However, the LDL particles in DM are more atherogenic than in nondiabetics, even though they are not elevated by DM alone. DM frequently results in lower HDL levels as well. (Kasper, pp. 2167-2168)
67. (D) The vertebral bodies in osteoporosis may become increasingly biconcave because of weakening of the subchondral plates. This results in "codfish" vertebra. When vertebral collapse occurs, the anterior height of the vertebra is usually decreased. Plain x-rays are insensitive diagnostic tools because up to $30 \%$ of bone mass can be lost without any apparent x-ray changes. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and CT scan are more sensitive tests for bone loss, but their exact clinical role has not been clearly established. (Kasper, pp. 2268-2269)
68. (B) Aspirin is given in low doses such as 325 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day, although the initial studies were done with higher doses. Carotid endarterectomy is the best treatment for stenoses of $70 \%$ or more. (Kasper, pp. 2367-2377)
69. (C) Later symptoms of hypothyroidism include loss of intellectual and motor activity, declining appetite, dry hair and skin, and deepening voice. In the elderly, hypothyroidism can be misdiagnosed as due to aging or to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, or depression. (Kasper, pp. 2108-2111)
70. (D) Radiation therapy in stage 1A Hodgkin's disease has a very high cure rate. Patients must be followed for hypothyroidism. The long-term disease-free survival is $80 \%$. Mantle irradiation can result acutely in transient dry mouth, pharyngitis, fatigue, and weight loss. The most common long-term effect is hypothyroidism (in $30 \%$ of cases), but radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis or pericardial disease can occur.

Although radiotherapy alone would be acceptable in this case, there is a trend to add chemotherapy as well. (Kasper, pp. 654-655)
71. (A) PAN may be associated with hepatitis B antigenemia in $30 \%$ of cases, suggesting immunologic phenomena in the pathogenesis of the disease. Aneurysmal dilatations along involved arteries are characteristic and their presence in small- and medium-sized arteries in renal, hepatic, and visceral vasculature is diagnostic. Biopsy of involved areas can also be diagnostic. (Kasper, pp. 2007-2008)
72. (E) CMV can also cause neurologic complications from CNS infection. Treatment is with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir. Relapse rates are high with both drugs, and therefore maintenance therapy is mandatory. (Kasper, pp. 1104-1123)
73. (B) Most patients have fever, pain, chills, elevated alkaline phosphatase, as well as increased conjugated bilirubin. Mechanical obstruction is most commonly due to stones, tumors, or strictures. For reasons that are unclear, the serum bilirubin tends to plateau and rarely exceeds levels of $600 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}(25 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL). (Kasper, pp. 238-240)
74. (B) Dysplastic nevi and benign acquired nevi are both most common on sun-exposed areas such as the back. Atypical moles can occur on the scalp, breasts, and buttocks, rare areas for benign acquired nevi. Both lesions are usually associated with similar lesions (10-40 on average for benign nevi, often $>100$ in the case of dysplastic nevi). Dysplastic nevi are larger ( $>6 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) and have irregular pigmentation and borders. (Kasper, p. 501)
75. (E) Prerenal azotemia usually has urine osmolality over 500, urine creatinine over 40, and fractional excretion of sodium $<1$. The urinary sediment in prerenal azotemia reveals hyaline casts. In intrinsic renal azotemia, muddy brown granular casts are seen. (Kasper, pp. 247-248)76. (D) The behavioral respiratory control system of the brain drives the hyperventilation, which leads to decreased $\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and increased pH . If alkalemia is present with the hypocarbia, symptoms can be quite significant. They include dizziness, visual impairment, syncope, and seizures secondary to cerebral vasoconstriction; paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, and tetany (secondary to decreased free serum calcium); muscle weakness (secondary to hypophosphatemia); and cardiac arrhythmias (secondary to alkalemia). (Kasper, pp. 1572-1573)
77. (D) Early ischemic changes are tall, peaked T waves that then develop into inverted T waves. Elevated ST segments and Q waves also occur early. (Kasper, pp. 1448-1449)
78. (B) Renal elimination of phenobarbital is enhanced by alkalinization of the urine to a pH of 8 with sodium bicarbonate and fluids. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are reserved for extreme cases with refracting hypotension. Short-acting barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, so fluid administration and alkalinization are not helpful. Activated charcoal absorbs barbiturates very effectively and is useful in decontamination of the GI tract. (Kasper, p. 2589)
79. (E) Exposure to ionizing radiation is more likely to cause cancer if it occurs at an early age. Radiation-induced malignancy tends to occur at the same age as the same malignancy in the general population. This suggests that radiation is not the only factor. (Kasper, pp. 486-488)
80. (D) Men are affected twice as frequently as women. The most apparent sign of the supranuclear ophthalmoplegia is failure of voluntary saccadic gaze in the downward direction. Tremor is unusual, but dementia is common. Medications may help somewhat, but their impact is limited and rarely sustained. (Kasper, pp. 2413-2414)
81. (D) The loop diuretics inhibit tubular reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the loop of Henle and can continue to cause
diuresis even during volume contraction. The likely site of action of furosemide is in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. (Kasper, pp. 1373-1374)
82. (D) INH acts as a pyridoxine antagonist and causes polyneuropathy in slow acetylators. Both sensory and motor involvement occurs. Treatment with pyridoxine can improve symptoms. (Kasper, pp. 947-948)
83. (B) The first stage of Lyme disease is an acute infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, usually transmitted by tick bite. It is most common in the summer in rural, wooded areas. About $60 \%$ of patients who have not received antibiotic therapy will develop arthritis months later. The typical pattern is intermittent attacks of oligoarthritis lasting weeks to months. The knees are the most common joints involved. (Kasper, pp. 996-997)
84. (A) AZT is beneficial to patients with HIV infection, but the best time at which to commence therapy is still controversial. Common side effects include fatigue, macrocytic anemia, neutropenia, and myopathy. Treatment regimens now include protease inhibitors as well. Monotherapy with AZT results in development of resistance. (Kasper, pp. 1124-1125)
85. (C) The mortality from acute myocardial infarction is greater in women, particularly African American women. It is unclear whether this correlation is independent of age and disease severity. Ischemic heart disease, not breast cancer, is the leading cause of death in American women. The relative benefit of thrombolytic therapy seems similar in men and women. Estrogen therapy's major effect in decreasing mortality is via its reduction ( $40-50 \%$ ) in deaths due to ischemic heart disease. This has not yet been verified in prospective trials. Estrogen therapy has not been shown to be beneficial in secondary prevention of heart disease in women. Immunerelated disorders (RA, lupus, multiple sclerosis, thyroid disease) are usually more common in women. (Kasper, pp. 29-30)86. (D) Alpha-methyldopa has been used extensively throughout pregnancy, with no evidence of harm to the fetus. ACE inhibitors are associated with increased fetal loss. Preeclampsia and eclampsia are diseases of the end of pregnancy. There is no evidence that pregnancy affects the course of essential hypertension. Gestational hypertension has a high rate of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies. (Kasper, pp. 32-33)
87. (A) CMV is the most common congenital viral infection, affecting $1-2 \%$ of all American newborns. Only a small minority of these infants are abnormal. N. gonorrhoeae infection can be transmitted in utero, during delivery, or in the postpartum period. Asymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in up to $7 \%$ of all pregnancies. Treatment can prevent about $75 \%$ of all acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy; thus, screening is warranted. HIV infection is usually transmitted during the perinatal period. Although postpartum infections are a significant cause of maternal mortality, the most important are thromboembolic disease, hypertension, ectopic pregnancy, and hemorrhage. (Kasper, pp. 36-38)
88. (E) This story of daily attacks of periorbital pain with annual recurrence in a man between age $30-50$ is typical of cluster headaches. The recurrent bouts last days to weeks. The headaches can be provoked by alcohol and relieved by oxygen administration. Prophylactic treatment, however, is preferred. (Kasper, pp. 93-94)
89. (E) Wernicke's aphasia involves disease (most commonly infarction) in the distribution of the lower division of the middle cerebral artery. It is frequently associated with parietal lobe sensory deficits and hemianopsia; motor disturbance is not part of the syndrome. The condition may improve with time. (Kasper, pp. 146-147)
90. (C) The ECG reveals diffuse ST elevation with characteristic concave upward shape and PR depression in the precordial leads. This is more typical of pericarditis than of myocardial infarction. The presentation, symptoms, and age of the patient are all typical for viral pericarditis. (Kasper, pp. 1414-1415)
91. (B) Community-acquired pneumonia in previously healthy young people is commonly caused by S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma, viruses, or Chlamydia. The pattern of dense right upper lobe consolidation in this case strongly suggests a typical bacterial pneumonia, such as S. pneumoniae. A follow-up CXR in 6 weeks is appropriate to ensure that no underlying abnormality is the cause of the problem. (Kasper, p. 1536)
92. (D) The CXR is typical of COPD, with flattened diaphragms, hyperlucent lungs, and increased retrosternal air space. (Kasper, p. 1551)
93. (E) Renal, musculoskeletal, and peripheral nerve involvement are the most common manifestations of PAN. Generally, if no tissue is easily available for biopsy, an arteriogram is a better diagnostic test than a blind biopsy. This arteriogram reveals multiple aneurysmal dilatations, the classic finding in PAN. (Kasper, pp. 2007-2008)
94. (D) The $x$-ray reveals typical evidence of sacroiliitis, with widening of the joints, sclerosis, and evasions. Similar findings can be seen in psoriatic and enteropathic spondyloarthropathy. (Kasper, pp. 1993-1995)
95. (C) The articular calcification chondrocalcinosis is typical for pseudogout or calcium pyrophosphate disease (CPPD). The most common joint involved is the knee, but the wrist, shoulder, ankle, elbow, and hand are also frequently involved. Definitive diagnosis depends on finding typical rhomboid-shaped crystals with weak-positive birefringence in the synovial fluid, but chondrocalcinosis in the correct setting allows a presumptive diagnosis. Numerous diseases are associated with CPPD, but the most common predisposing factor is advancing age. (Kasper, pp. 2047-2048)
96. (B) The x-ray reveals a Zenker's diverticulum. Halitosis, aspiration (perhaps explaining his pneumonia), regurgitation of old meals, and dysphagia are typical symptoms. Surgical treatment involves a cricopharyngeal myotomy.At times, a diverticulectomy is also required. (Kasper, p. 1745)
97. (C) The film shows hypochromic, microcytic red cells, suggesting iron deficiency. Although thalassemia can mimic iron deficiency, the normal hemoglobin 1 year earlier makes this unlikely. Anemia of chronic disease is unlikely because there are no signs of such a chronic disease. Thus, blood loss from the GI tract is the most likely cause. (Kasper, pp. 589-590)
98. (A) The macrocytic cells and hypersegmented neutrophil are characteristic of megaloblastic anemia. Vitamin $B_{12}$ and folate deficiency are the most common cause. Lack of intrinsic factor because of gastrectomy will eventually result in $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ deficiency. (Kasper, p. 604)
99. (D) Coronary angiography is a relatively safe procedure in the right individual. There are complications associated with this procedure that must be reviewed with the patient while obtaining informed consent. The risk of stroke and myocardial infarction is 1 in 1000 with coronary angiography. Other complications are arrhythmias, allergic reaction to the dye, and renal dysfunction. (Kasper, pp. 1327-1328)
100. (C) The major bleeding complication rate with long-term warfarin anticoagulation is approximately $1-3 \%$ per year when the target international normalized ratio (INR) is 2-3. (Kasper, pp. 689-690)
101. (B) Beta-adrenergic receptors become less sensitive with advancing age. Higher rates of isoproterenol infusion are required in the elderly to achieve an increased resting heart rate. Clinically, higher doses of propranolol have been shown to be required in the elderly to achieve similar degrees of beta-blockade as in the young. (Grimley Evans, pp. 132-133)
102. (A) The response to benzodiazepines is more pronounced in the elderly, even when corrected for pharmacokinetics. Prior impairment is a factor in this response. (Grimley Evans, pp. $132-133$ )
103. (A) Despite similar pharmacokinetics, the dose of warfarin to provide effective anticoagulation is lower in the elderly. (Grimley Evans, p. 132)
104. (E) The elderly have more body fat and less body water. A water-soluble drug such as lithium will have a considerably smaller volume of distribution. Thus, dosages should be decreased in the elderly to prevent toxicity. (Grimley Evans, p. 130)
105. (A) Failure to correct for the elderly patient's increased sensitivity to narcotics can result in significant toxicity. (Grimley Evans, p. 132)
106. (A) Tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs are both effective treatments for depression, but their side effect profiles are different. Tricyclics can promote weight gain while weight loss is more common with SSRIs. (Grimley Evans, pp. 993-994)
107. (C) Diuretics promote urinary losses of magnesium, zinc, and potassium. Zinc deficiency is also seen in liver cirrhosis, Type II diabetes, and lung cancer. (Grimley Evans, p. 163)
108. (D) INH can result in pyridoxine (vitamin $B_{6}$ ) deficiency, particularly in malnourished individuals. It is recommended that patients who are elderly, or have DM, poor nutrition, alcoholism, seizure diathesis, or uremia, take pyridoxine while on INH. (Grimley Evans, p. 538)
109. (G) Corticosteroids impair calcium absorption. They are useful in managing hypercalcemia, but bisphosphonates are the usual drug of choice. (Grimley Evans, p. 183)
110. (E) Both phenytoin and phenobarbital can cause altered vitamin D metabolism and can even result in osteomalacia. Calcium absorption from the gut is also blocked directly. (Grimley Evans, p. 628)
111. (B) Sleep becomes more shallow with the loss of deep stages of sleep, resulting in more frequent arousals. Specific sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and periodic leg movementsincrease with advancing age as well. (Grimley Evans, p. 758)
112. (B, F) Neurodegenerative disorders can cause a change in normal circadian rhythm by causing a breakdown in the temporal organizing of sleep-wake cycling. This alteration in time of sleeping can be very disruptive to family members. The sleep pattern can be polyphasic, with multiple irregularly distributed periods of sleep, rather than one long sleep period at night. This can result in the patient's awakening during the night, which is also very disruptive. (Grimley Evans, pp. 756-758)
113. (E) Sleep apnea syndrome is the most common cause of daytime sleepiness in the elderly. The prevalence (at least in sleep disorder centers) increases with advancing age. Narcolepsy (usually having started earlier in life) and periodic limb movement disorder (restless legs) are other common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness. (Grimley Evans, p. 750)
114. (C) The lack of focal neurologic findings suggests that the confusion is secondary to delirium. Bilateral asterixis is frequently seen in metabolic encephalopathy, particularly in cases of hepatic encephalopathy, hypercapnia, or drug ingestion. In this case, the most urgent investigations would be to rule out pneumonia with respiratory failure. (Kasper, pp. 1627-1629)
115. (E) Although impaired attention is the hallmark of delirium (along with impaired consciousness), it can also be impaired in dementia. In very mild
cognitive impairment, deficits in attention might differentiate delirium from dementia, but in the usual hospitalized patient, fluctuation in performance (particularly with regard to attention and level of consciousness) is probably more helpful. (Kasper, pp. 1624-1625)
116. (B) The progressive nature of the disorder suggests a degenerative dementia, and the predominance of disinhibited behavior suggests the frontal lobes are involved. Frontal dementias can result from trauma, tumor, or ischemia, but this history suggests a degenerative disorder. Alzheimer's can involve the frontal lobes and mimic a frontal dementia. (Kasper, pp. 2401-2402)
117. (D) In frontal dementia, and others as well, behavioral disturbances are often the reason for institutionalization. (Kasper, pp. 2405-2406)
118. (E) Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in Western countries. Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing A-beta-amyloid in the neuronal cytoplasm. These plaques stain silver and are referred to as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). There is also accumulation of A-beta-amyloid in arterial walls of cerebral blood vessels.
